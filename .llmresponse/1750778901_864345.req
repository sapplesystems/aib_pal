There is no comparison between food served bY Chinese restaurants in the United States and that served by restaurants in Hong Kong and Taiwan, he said. However, be did say that a few Chinese restaurants in this country do a fair job, especially if a person orders from the Cltinese language portion of the menu and not the English language part.

These include the Grandview Garden and Man- darin Plaza, as well as otherswhich specialize in food native to certa,in provinces in China. 'China Lake' hard to explain Dr. Yu said the fact that he worl<s at a place named "China Lake" has been a matter of special interest to friends and relatives in the Far East.
