Rich in historical treasures and superlatively endowed with nat   ural beauty, she is, to-day, a city of adobe ruins, and gullied streets, overlooking the bay from one of the grandest and most beautiful town sites nature ever formed. The harbor in Monterey Bay is unequalcd on the Pacific ocean. The largest battle-ships of our navy find shelter within 100 feet of shore: and, during heavy storms at sea, it is not unusual to see ships of different nations anchored in the calm waters thereof. The most noted navigators credit this bay as the safest, and predict the day is not far off when this will be one of the first ports of the nation. The fishing is incomparable for quality, quantity, and variety. top-water and deep-sea fishing. About two miles from Monterey is PACIFIC GROVE If beauty and grandure of scenery, a delightful climate, a genial sun, a blue sky and soft breezes make an earthly paradise, then indeed Pacific Grave is fully entitled to that name.

A glance at the map of Pacific Grove and its surroundings must at once con- vince the reader that this rural city has an ideal location. What a grand and exalt- ing panorama is seen from the heights of this promontory! What enchanting views one must have everywhere, whether standing on some stern rock on the wave wash- ed shore or sauntering through the ozone laden pine forests! What charming nooks and corners these forests and this ocean worn coast must afford! The natural beau- REMNANTS OF THE PAST

which includes the origi   nal sixty acres of conference grounds acquired by the YWCA a half century ago, now com   prises ninety-eight acres of beautiful shore line on the Pacific Ocean side of the headland. If only this round earth of ours, so beautiful as God created it, its continents en   closed by blue unsullied oceans, were for all peoples, like Asilomar, a Sanctuary by the Sea! Pacific Grove lies on a headland: on the West the Pacific Ocean, on the East, Monterey Bay. Asilomar is on its Western side, fronting the sea that lies between it and the far world of the East. From Monterey a scenic highway runs along the coast to Asilomar. It runs past the flowering coastal park and Lover's Point, planted by Hayes Perkins and Julia Platt, the latter a former mayor of Pacific Grove (see articles elsewhere in this volume), past the ex   tensive municipal golf course, to Asilomar and along the coast on the Seventeen Mile Drive. Asilomar may also be approached more directly across the City of Pacific Grove down S
