eling its development work, AOD carries out the equal- ly important task of testing and evaluating the armament-control systems conceived and nurtured by its engineers and scientists. To perform this function AOD operates and maintains a set of highly instrumented ranges. It also has its own data reduction and data analysis groups which specialize in the assessment and analysis of aircraft armament- control and missile flight-test data_ The most important function of this analysis work is to un- cover sources of error, deficien- cies in design, and manufactur- ing weaknesses. Test Dept. "0ne test is worth a thousand opinions." This maxim is espec- ially true for ordnance work where the realm of unexplored phenomena is immense. The development of modern weapons requires huge amounts of preCise data on the perform. ance of preliminary designs. First, it is necessary to find out quickly whether a new design works. Second, after an initial success it is necessary to prove through further tests that results can be

a back and forth, providing capabil- ity which never existed before." Safty said the re historically is a tremendous cost savings any time a simu- lated test is performed in one of the labs rather than an expensive flight test involv- ing Navy aircraft. When higher fidelity testing is required than is possible with the F/A-18 or HWIL labs alone, the tool is now m place to test the integrated sys- tem. "The ever-increasing complexity and interdependency of weapon systems requires a shift in our focus from tradi- tional weapon system testing to total weapon system testing," emphasized Michele Wagner, ofSpecial Projects. " In traditional weapon systems testing we focus on the performance of the weapon separately from the performance of the weapon's platform. In so doing, we may not completely test the interface of complex weapon systems such as the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air- to-Air Missi_le (AMRAAM). This link provides a means to evaluate total weapon system performance in an extremely cost- effective ma

ring the symposium, attendees were familiarized with weapons pro- grams at China Lake through visual and audio displays in Hangar 3, technical briefings, actual demonstration flights of weapons systems and tours of facilities, including, F/A-18 Weapons Systems Support Activity, Weapons Survivability Laboratory, Echo Range and the Simulation Lab. The west bay of Hangar 3 was used for static displays of weapons develop- ment programs and related facilities wit.h subject experts available to answer ques- tions anti present information. Displays included hardware and software on the Pacific Range and Facilities, HUUMV(ATIMS), JSOW, JOAM DAMASK, Rapid Targeting System, Crew Systems, A-6 and A-7 FMS, AIM- 9X, F/A-18 Instrumentation, China Lake Propulsion Lab, Telemetry, Russian radar equipment, Combat 10, SLAM/Harpoon, JHMCS, Global Positioning System, survivability and the Tailhook Association.

ported by the Test and Evaluation Department's air range personnel, have recently concluded tests designed to im- prove upon flight delivery tactics against seaborne targets. Called "War-at-Sea" the program, initiated in July 1973, was carried out on tbe dry bed of Airport Lake on NWC's in- strumented moving target range. Purposes of the tests were to cletennine the accuracy that different types of aircraft can achieve wilen delivering varied types of, weapons against an elusive sea target. A QM56 tank, remotely controlled from atq> a   hill at the lake, was used as the target. Tbe striking aircraft deliveredConventional iron bomb weapons, Mark 71 Mod 1 Zuni rockets, and 20mm gun projectiles. Day and Night Tesls Staged A7E Corsair IT and A6E Intruder aircraft were used during both day and night deliveries. Flare illumination was used after dark. In addition, the feasibility of laser-guided weapons was tested. Pilots involved during th~ tests were LCdr. L. J. Chrans, Capt. ROnald Hulling (USAF), U. Frank Wesh,

 only seconds later. Commenting on the significance of the test, F/A-18 Integrated Program Team Deputy Cdr. Steve Burris said, "This is the first airplane that will be able to suppress a threat itself and follow up with a hard kill on that same threat or a target in the vicinity. Hamilton praised the hard work that went into the suc- cessful event. "This started many years ago with the HARM weapon itself, working up through the F/A-18 ElF program at Patuxent River with weapon separation offthe airplane and culminating here at China Lake with a tactical delivery oftwo HARM onto actual targets." It was 'the first full system live-fire test of the f/A- l8EIF program with forward firing ordnance. The shot consisted of firing two High Speed Anti Radiation Missiles, which are used to disable enemy radar sites, protecting aircraft and pilots during a mission. The radars used during the test simulated surface-to-air missile sys- tems, similar to those used against U.S. and friendly forces during the Gulf War. "In thi

H- ow NOTS Partners Technical programs at NOTS begin with a basic idea, progressing through a process of germination, to come out ~s completed weapon systems. Behind the successful weap- ons developed at OTS there exists two valuable assets- know-how and teamwork. Supporting t his (eamwork and know-how are well-mannered and . well-equjpped laborator- ies and test facilities for testing ideas in the initial and final    stages of development. Through development and test programs NOTS experi- ments with many new ideas. Testing of originllJ- designs and retesting of modified designs helps to develop practical weapons for fleet use. Test results are recorded by up-to- date photographic and electronic equipment. Modern data assessment equipment converts (est films and electronic data into graphs and tables to provide an accurate picture of the behavior of tested weapon systems.

Test Dept.. Test Department first entered the SIDEWINDER program in early 1951, when it was requested to h elp in the design of the seek er system. By July the SIDE\VThT))ER pro- ject was far enough along that the Test Del)artment Project Engineer- ing Office was put in charge of the first SIDEWINDER firings a.t the 6-deg rami) to test the dwnmy air- frame for stability and drag, and to obtain trajectory and ballistic data. A typical weapon-develop- ment pattern of design, test, and modify emerged. The foremost NOTS ranges were used for this: K-2 for a long series of tests of warhead lethality and fuze function, Projectile Range for firings from a special ramp at tar- gets to further assess fuze func- tion, and B-4 for developmental fir- ings of the fuze and other compon- ents, and to test reliability and op- erability
