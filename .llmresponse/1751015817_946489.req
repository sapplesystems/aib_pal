Prof. C. S. Nash of Pacific Theological Seminary Berkeley, Calif., says:    Pacific Grove is one of the most charming resorts on the Pacific Coast. The matchless Bay and the great Ocean just beyond are endlessly fascinating Especially in winter have 1 found the place restful and invigorating.    Rev.
