However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to display physical maps. But I can provide you with text-based directions, descriptions, or even generate simple text-based maps for you!\n\nIf you're looking for a specific type of map, such as a topographic map, a road map, or a satellite image, I can try to help you find it. You can ask me questions like:\n\n* What type of map are you looking for?\n* What region or area are you interested in?\n* Do you have a specific purpose or goal in mind for the map?\n\nI'll do my best to assist you in finding the information you need!"}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 15, 'completion_tokens': 141, 'total_tokens': 156}}
