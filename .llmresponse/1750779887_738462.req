ton of the Attack Weapons Depanment's ARM Weapons's Office said China Lake provides not only range time to the Air Force, but does test planning, collects data, conducts data analysis, provides targets, sets them up and gives the evaluation squadrons an end-game analysis. China Lakers also conduct six-degree- of-freedom simulations with HARM to determine missile firing boundaries for each test. More than 12 China Lake per- sonnel from the. Range and Attack Weapons departments participated in making Combat Hammer possible, according to Featherston The missiles were  evaluated during a deployment by 4486th Fighter Weapons Squadron personnel deployed to George AFB. The actual evaluations took place on the then Naval Weapons Center's ranges. During Combat Hammer evaluations, units from active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserves fly combat scenarios against simulated ground and air threat arrays to fire against a realistic target. "This was the most successful HARM evaluation to date," said Ist Lt. Kur

"Because the Range Department, Alliant Techsystems and the Army knew from the beginning that the DU rounds would eventually have to be cleaned up, they tried to contain the contamination during test- ing," he explained. To test for accuracy, projectiles were fired at targets suspended from poles 3,000 meters away. A 60-foot-Iong steel catch box was constructed on the hillside behind the target and filled with sand, and most of the projectiles entered the box's 20-by-20-foot f
