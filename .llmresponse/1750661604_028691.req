Incidentally, a friend of mine who lives in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, said that documents there indicated that a group from Ocean Grove was very deeply involved in the early development of Pacific Grove. I don't believe I had read that in any of the material I have about it. Sincerely, C   ~,/1 ~ I ,Q ~ 7y1.,G'4.~ !r, S ~ s~-~   t ~,~ e ~ ~l~LYQ'a G~ /~ Y
