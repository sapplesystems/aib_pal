another building or monument bearing the President's name. Its planners envision it as a living and working memorial, expressing President Ken   nedy's concern for his country and the world. Tbe library will include a museum which will house many of the mementos associated with President Kennedy and his times. Those planning it hope to make the experiences of recent history as vivid as possible for visitors, especially students and young people. There will also be an archive which will contain President Kennedy's personal papers, as well as copies of public records necessary for an understanding of the actions of his administra   tion. The archive will be used primarily by scholars and research   ers. A third component of the Library will be an institute, with the central purpose of educating young people in the under   standing and practice of democratic political life. It will offer scholarships, research material, lectures, seminars and public programs to help achieve these purposes. The cost of the Kenned

gularly blessed. For this we are thankful. Accept this prayer of gratitude for the life and work of Thy servant, our deceased President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. We commit him to Thy iudgment and keep- ing, and to the hallowed pages of our history. Comfort the hearts of his parents, brothers and sisters, his beloved wife and children. Bring a sense of calm to our troubled hearts in these hours of world tension and peril. Make us strong in faith toward Thee. Grant wisdom and health to Lyndon B. Johnson as he assumes the ponderous duties of office. Unite us as a nation. Turn the hearts of our enemies. Let peace, for which John Kennedy worked without stint, become a realized dream in our time. To this end we pray, in the name of the divine Lord. Amen. ROBERT C.

C, his visit was arranged by the Technical Presentations Coor- dinator, Dick Rusciolelli. "I had arranged for the new skipper to he served breakfast at the Commissioned Officers' Mess," Dick recalled. "Normally, they don't serve breakfast, so Jack (Mussier) and I , arrived at the COM early to see that everything was all right. There was no cook present, and the manager was also absent, so Jack turned to me and said, 'Do you want to cook, or serve?' I acted as the waitress, and Jack whipped up Richard W. Rusciolelli a good breakfast for Adm. Moran. What a way to start off with a new Commander," Dick laughed. The visit of then President John F. Kennedy was prohably the most exciting event that has occurred in Dick's 14 years with the office. He ranks meeting Allen Beam, the fourth man on the moon, as another exciting occurrence. "The function of the office is to see that there are no foul-ups during a visit by persons who come to NWC,1t Dick explained. "I'm fortooate in that I have a very good staff, and hoo-il

or one thing he's young. He is a new generation coming into power. People are hoping that new ideas and new approaches will find solutions to contemporary problems. FORWARD LOOKING PEOPLE i\Iy observations refer only to this area. Maybe the residents of NOTS comprise a bigger percentage of forward-looking people -not backward looking. Another reason for Kennedy'S popularity is that he doesn't talk down to anybody and I doubt if he talks up to anybody. He talks straight across. And his voice ca rries an unde rtone of sincerity. Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt both had that quality. WHAT THE POLLSTERS FIGURE The Gallop poll national popularity figures report a slip- ping from 83% two years ago to 64% last monlh. But in this area, Friday, June 7, I would estimate his popu- larity to be close to 100%. And if elections were tomorrow and success depended on the \'ote of tbis area he would have it made.
