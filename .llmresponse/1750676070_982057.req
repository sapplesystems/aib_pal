ip down. Best wishes on your success with the National Register--and continu- ing research on Pacific Grove. Incidentally, a friend of mine who lives in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, said that documents there indicated that a group from Ocean Grove was very deeply involved in the early development of Pacific Grove. I don't believe I had read that in any of the material I have about it. Sincerely, C   ~,/1 ~ I ,Q ~ 7y1.,G'4.~ !r, S ~ s~-~   t ~,~ e ~ ~l~LYQ'a G~ /~ Y

on its own terms, so that for thousands attending Chautauqua, the Feast of Lanterns or an encampment at Asilomar, Pacific Grove was more than just a name on the map at the end of the SP line. Pacific Grove was an event before it was a place. Over the years, much has changed. Most obviously, the spaces have been filled in, both within the town and between it and its neighbors, so that boundaries have become less distinct and less meaningful. Yet Pacific Grove has retained its self- conscious identity. For many of its citizens, oldtimers and newcomers alike, the exceptional feeling of community is as notable as the natural beauty of the town. Pacific Grove   area: one square mile, population: 1300   was incorporated in 1889. Today, the area has nearly tripled, and the population has climbed to 18,000. Who has come? What brought them here? What have they brought with them? No single answer can be given, for the local population has grown considerably more diverse since the days when this was a Methodist retreat.

Pacific Grove is to the Pacific Coast what Martha's Vineyard and Ocean Grove are to the Atlantic, except that Pacific Grove lias as perfect a climate in winter as in summer and is kept open all the year round. T -d , The history of Pacific Grove fur- s ecor nishes striking evidence of the rare value of climate and healthy moral surroundings. A few years ago it was started as a camping ground bv the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was laid out in lots, and tents made of cloth stretched over wooden frames were erected. Soon, however, it outgrew its original purpose. Tasteful cottages were built, stores sprang into existence, and the popu   lation increased beyond all expectation.
