Apprentices make the journey
Steve Mason was working in the plum—
bing trade when he realized he wanted
to go back to school to upgrade his
skills. “I was interested in better educa—
tion,” he explains. “I wanted more
knowledge about my craft.”
After a relative told him about an
area apprenticeship program, Mason
signed up. Last June he was selected as
one of the Outstanding Apprentices by
the Jacksonville General Apprenticeship
Association. Upon graduation from the
program, he became a journeyman and
now makes more money in his field.
The apprenticeship program is a joint
venture of several groups of which
FCC] is a part. The College qualifies
the instructors and provides ad—
ministrative support for the various
programs.
The association’s 40th annual gradua—
tion ceremony is scheduled for May 26
at the Morocco Temple where some 45
to 55 men will graduate from appren—
tice to journeyman. The ceremony will
also honor one Outstanding Apprentice
from each of the following trades:
carpentry, plumbing, pipe fitting, elec—
 
The Green Scene:
Landscaping Ideas
 
I’m branching out in my line of work
at Plant Services by starting a column
on landscaping tips for Outlook readers.
Spring is naturally a good time to in-
troduce the column. In this issue I’ll
guide you step—by—step on how to
beautify your landscape at home with a
variety of annual plants and how to
construct your ﬂower beds.
Put all ideas for your ﬂower bed im—
provements on paper so that all
elements involved in developing the
ground can be seen. Do not plan more
features than your lot can conveniently
hold. Arrange plants carefully. Plant
low maintenance plants to beautify
your lawn.
First, sculpture out your ﬂower bed
with an edger. Then remove all debris
and unsightly materials where the top—
soil goes for planting. If necessary, turn
the soil to make it easier for planting.
Measure the ﬂower bed before going
to the nursery to purchase your annual
plants. Keep in mind while measuring
your bed that ﬂowers should be planted
at least 18 inches apart to insure full
plant growth. Pick healthy plants, not
trical, sheet metal, heat—frost insulating,
operating engineering and millwork.
The Outstanding Apprentices are
selected on the basis of proficiency, per—
formance and attendance during their
indenture.
Locally, one in 10 people is employed
in construction or construction—related
fields, according to Fred Bucky, vice
president of the association. The same
ratio is true for the national level, he
added.
Industry analysts indicate the field
will be short of labor in the mid—19905.
The demand for workers is increasing,
perhaps because applicants are not
responding the way they were five years
ago, said Louis Toth, president of the
association.
“The primary function of the associa—
tion is to promote good quality appren—
ticeship and sponsor the graduating
ceremonies,” Toth said. The association,
which is composed of representatives of
labor, management, education and
government, also keeps current with
legislation.
“Most of the graduates continue to
 
wilted ones. Don’t buy too many dif—
ferent varieties for the ﬂower bed, as it
takes away from the contrast. Attractive
ﬂower beds can be created with one
plant species.
When planting, dig a hole twice the
size of the pot that the plant came in.
carry on in the work they’ve been
doing,” Toth said. Other avenues in—
clude journeyman, supervision or com—
pany ownership. “The sky’s the limit,”
said Toth.
Approximately 300 young men and
women participate in the programs in
the Jacksonville area, said Leon Dorsett,
FCC] program manager of Trade and
Industrial Services. They’re indentured
for four years while they work on the
job 40 hours a week under the supervi—
sion of experienced journeymen. In ad—
dition, apprentices attend two evening
classes a week from September to June
during their indenture. Classes are held
throughout the area at specific sites
built for training purposes.
For more information about programs
that begin in September, call the follow—
ing number of the desired program:
carpentry, 771—4141; plumbing,
781—2112; pipe fitting, 781—2112; elec—
trical, 737—7533; sheet metal, 396—2199;
insulating, 355—4881; operating
engineering, 783—6181.

Cow manure is good plant food and is
100 percent organic. Place cow manure
in the hole and fill it to the top with
water. After separating the plant from
the pot, place the plant in the center of
the hole and pack the remaining dirt
around it. Don’t plant the ﬂowers any
higher or lower than they were in the
original container.
Annuals are short—lived plants that
grow continuously. They need adequate
moisture throughout their growing to
keep them from wilting, but not so
much that the soil remains saturated
and drowns the roots.
Spring annuals: marigolds, snap—
dragons, petunias, impatiens, geraniums,
salvia, calendula, pansies and scarlet
sage are just a few now available.
After planting all your ﬂowers, add
mulch to your flower bed to beautify it
and keep out the weeds. This completes
your ﬂower bed.
