 
Literacy and the
By Lavada Haupt
For many years Steve Wise wanted to
see changes made in the overall educa—
tional system of Florida. Increased
numbers of students dropped out of
high school, and Wise saw the correla—
tion between the high school dropout
rate, literacy and detention in the
juvenile system.
Those concerns, coupled with the in-
ability of many students to attend col-
lege because of expenses, child care ser—
vices, disability, and other reasons,
prompted Wise to campaign for the
state District 14 seat when Carl Ogden
resigned to work for Gov. Bob
Martinez. Wise is the vice president of
Institutional Advancement at FCC].
“Improving education has been one
of my greatest goals,” Wise said, upon
entering his second legislative session in
Tallahassee, where he welcomes the op—
portunity to help improve education
and to give every Floridian the same
educational opportunity. The session
began in April and will conclude in
June.
Fighting literacy problems must
become an all encompassing goal of
every decision maker in the nation, ac
cording to Wise. He believes that the
young juveniles in the justice system
need an opportunity to learn. “They
need that deterrent, and once they
begin to learn, they will understand
that learning is fun and that doing
good is not a bad thing.”
Wise and his state legislative assistant
have worked tirelessly in their efforts to
evaluate the Juvenile Justice System. He
spent Fridays last summer examining
the system, while the majority of col—
lege employees were scheduled to work
Monday through Thursday during the
summer schedule.
When is registration? What are the
latest special course offerings? Is FCC]
sponsoring any events this weekend?
When and where?
The answers to these questions can
be found by calling the number to
FCC] ’s newest information resource
tool. The College recently joined an inv
teractive phone service that puts callers
in touch with approximately 100
listings, including the Mayor’s Office, a
Home and Garden Menu and a Na-
tional Sports Menu.
The CityLine is provided by WJKS
Channel 17 as a community service,
said Vice President/General Manager
Bill White. The CityLine number is
641—1717 and may be accessed from any
touchtone telephone. After dialing this
number, callers simply dial the category
number of their desired listing for in.
formation; some of the categories have
selections for more specific messages.
The service is free to local callers.
The FCC] category number is 3225,
and the five selections are registration,
Legislature
 
He is adamant in his belief that
FCCJ’s mission is to serve the local com—
munity and to improve the quality of
life within Jacksonville. That means
providing the opportunity for education.
Wise plans to make literacy a major
focus in the state Legislature. He
believes that most politicians who run
for the higher—level offices will join him
in this endeavor.
“One of the best ways to promote
literacy is through the state Legislature,”
Wise said. “Legislative decisions must be
made that will take a look at
kindergarten through 12th grade. This
includes students with learning
disabilities. They especially need direc‘
tions and encouragement that will help
them become productive, law—abiding
citizens.”
Wise said that the job training pro—
gram must continue to look at the
needs in the community, pinpoint
where training is needed and then pro-
vide the quality of training that
employers need. He expects specific
training services that FCC] provides for
the community businesses will expand
beyond the College’s greatest dreams.
Wise believes that Duval and Nassau
County schools and FCC] should con-
tinue to work together toward dual
enrollment. This program allows
students to earn their first year of col—
lege while in high school. The process
saves parents money and will ultimately
make it possible for some students to
continue their education.
Another way to combat literacy prob—
lems is to provide child care centers so
parents can attend classes. He believes a
system can be set up that will allow
parents to work in the centers to pay
for their child’s care.
Many students do not attend college
because they do not have transporta—
tion. He would like to see the state in-
stitute a Student Transportation Trust
Fund that would allow students with
photo passes to ride the bus for or 10
cents.
Wise plans to introduce into the 1989
state Legislature an increased DUI fine,
favorable lottery fund dispensation, and
parking fines with revenues earmarked
for the disabled. These bills would pro
vide additional avenues to help promote
the efforts to increase literacy.
Wise enjoys working for a cause in
which he believes. Perhaps that is why
Gov. Martinez appointed him to the
president’s committee for the handicap—
ped. He enjoys his work and says that
work is his hobby.
“When a person enjoys what he does,
it actually becomes his hobby,” said
Wise.

Local and national items featured
FCC] plugs into CityLine
special course offerings, admissions/
financial aid, general information and
events.
“CityLine will be an important
resource for up—to—date information
about registration, programs and
deadlines, not only for our current
students, but for the general public,”
emphasizes Admissions Officer Susan
Chappell.
The College joined the WJKS City-
Line in April at the suggestion of
White. His invitation was in response to
a presentation made to WJKS by FCC],
expressing its appreciation during Com—
munity College Week for the station’s
support as a media partner during the
past year.
As of mid-April, the service had
generated more than 750,000 phone
calls since it was introduced in January,
White said. WJKS distributed 400,000
directories throughout the area and also
promoted the CityLine at hotels, to let
locals and visitors know the latest about
civic and entertainment activities in the
area.
The CityLine’s main menus feature
information about business, civic and
public affairs, entertainment,
restaurants, health and fitness, home
and garden, news, real estate, general
items and music. Topics among the 100
listings are as diverse as the Convention
and Visitors Bureau, Volunteer Jackson-
ville, Soap Opera Update, Ask-A-Nurse,
Trivia Quiz and Joke of the Day.
Mini-directories are available at the
campus Student Activities offices and
Admissions offices. Complete CityLine
directories are available at WJKS Chan—
nel 17. Callers may request a directory
by sending a stamped, self-addressed
envelope to WJKS, 9117 Hogan Road,
