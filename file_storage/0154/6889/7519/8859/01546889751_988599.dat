Retirees celebrate a permanent holiday
 
Publication Jacksonville
The holidays give many of us the opportunity to spend time with current
friends. The holidays give others an “excuse”
to renew friendships with old ones. In keeping with this tradition, Outlook
has gotten in touch with some
former FCC] friends—Helen Foy, Elizabeth Reed and Jim Schroeer. And we
learned,
though they may be ghosts of a Christmas past, they are not forgotten.

former business manager, Kent [ﬁnal] ”I I&#39;m chnoffn/ a/
In her 19 years with FCC], Helen Foy,
who worked as a payroll clerk, accountant
and business manager at Kent, learned all
about handling money. Since her retirement
in 1989, however, she has been managing
her money in a completely different way.
“I play bingo three times a week, and I go
to Las Vegas five or six times a year,” Foy said.
“It’s really exciting!” While she enjoys sitting
at the blackjack table, it’s the dollar slots
where the real action is. Foy, who has won
$4,300 with one pull of the handle, hopes
lady luck is on her side again when she
competes in a slot tournament later this year.
But life is not all bright lights and big
cities for Foy. As a resident of St.
Augustine’s Vilano Beach, she also enjoys
the quiet life. “I have a beautiful view, and
the water is very soothing,” said Foy, who
shares her condo with Lacy, a two—pound,
longehaired Chihuahua. “I spend a lot of
time volunteering with local Catholic
charities, crocheting and embroidering.”
Admittedly, Foy misses her FCC] friends
and particularly her husband Chuck, a former
Downtown Campus employee who died in
1989. “[Retirement] has taking some getting
used to——I miss Chuck terribly—but I stay
busy,” she said. “And I like it that way.”
Elizabeth Reed
former professor of English/speech, South
Check Elizabeth Reed’s human resources
file and you’ll find she retired from the
College in 1990. Take a look at her sched—
ule, however, and you might not be so sure.
Though Reed officially retired from
FCC] in 1990, she currently serves as a
reader for the essay portion of the CLAST,
as well as editor of the College’s selfestudy
for the Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools reaccreditation. “I enjoy having
the opportunity to work with my colleagues
again, and doing so also allows me to keep
up with what’s going on in the field and
with the College,” Reed said.

In addition to her FCCJvrelated activities,
Reed has been keeping busy converting a
spare room into a sewing room. She has also
taken up a hobby she didn’t have time for
while teaching—baking. “I’ve made three
cobblers in two years,” she laughed. “That’s a
record for me.”
Reed and husband Charles, a former FCC]
professor of speech/humanities who retired in
1980, have also kept busy traveling across the
United States and throughout Europe.
Despite her busy schedule, Reed admita
ted she’s “not quite adjusted to retirement
yet.” For the FCC] students and staff who
benefit from her continuing work at the
College, they hope she never does.
Howard “Jim” Schroeer
former director of facilities
Though Jim Schroeer left his position as
Florida Junior College’s director of facilities
in 1984, construction is still very much a
part of his life.

Schroeer, who currently serves as deputy
commissioner of educational facilities for
the Department of Education, has been
busy with the rebuilding of Dade County
schools following Hurricane Andrew. “The
damage to schools alone is estimated at
$300 to $400 million; three schools were
destroyed, 10 schools are non—operational
and IOOeplus schools lost various portions of
their buildings,” he said.
On the brighter side, Schroeer has been
furthering his education at Florida ASLM
University’s School of Architecture and
Tallahassee Community College. He is also
building a home in Orange Park—a project
he has been working on for the last 13 years.
“The oldetimers will probably remember
I was working on my house when I was
there [at FJC],” he laughed. “But I’ll finish it
one day!”
In spite of Schroeer’s busy calendar, he
said he still misses the College. “It was really
exciting watching [the institution] change
and grow. And as a planner, I loved being in
the growth mode,” he said of his 17 years at
FJC. “It was a very rewarding experience.”
