Paula Thompson (natural sciences,
South) visited the National Mustard
in Mt. Horeb, Wis. on her recent
trip home. As Paula told the story of her
visit, I learned that a former district attorney
suffering from a grand case .of “burnout”
decided to bust out of the law business, and
in looking for something to keep him busy,
began collecting mustard jars. As his
collection grew, he came up with the idea of
creating a mustard museum. Voila! August
5th is now proclaimed to be National
Mustard Day and was the perfect time for
Paula’s visit. The museum “curator” now
has his own line of mustard called “Slim and
Nunne,” a name which depicts what his wife
said about his chances of making this idea
work. He has a mail—order catalog and offers
three ﬂavors of “Slim and Nunne,” along
with a T—shirt that says, “It’s not just for hot
dogs anymore,” showing an ice cream cone
with mustard on it. He was even inter—
viewed for a national TV show hosted by
Charles Osgood. All you have to do to
become a member of the National Mustard
Club is send him a jar that he doesn’t have
in his collection. You’ll then receive a T-
shirt and a membership certificate suitable
for framing. If any of you hot dogs out there
are interested in becoming members, give
Paula Thompson a call at 646—2333.
Romance among the ruins
When Nancy Garcia and Jack Myers
(Information Services) took a vacation trip
to Cancun, Mexico, little did Nancy know
that romance would be lurking among the
Aztec ruins that Cancun is famous for. She
wasn’t feeling particularly well
(Montezuma’s Revenge?) and couldn’t
understand why Jack insisted she climb the
hundred or so steps up to the top of the
ruins. Nancy found out it was worth the
effort when Jack, in a most romantic setting,
presented her with a beautiful diamond ring
and asked her to marry him. Seems there’s
more to Jack than meets the eye. We all
wish them many years of happy computing
together and know there’ll be no “ruining&quot;
this match.
An “inn” place to go
Joe Molenda (communications, Kent)
and wife Carolyn have every right to be
proud of their bed and breakfast inn, “The
Archibald.” It was just named one of the 10
best inns in the state of Florida by the Guide
to the Small and Historic Lodgings of Florida.
Considering the fact that there are ISO—some
inns in the state, this is quite a feather in
their cap, “shutting out” all the inns in St.
Augustine and Fernandina Beach. “The
Archibald,” circa 1903, was purchased by
Carolyn and Joe in 1988 and is situated
behind Downtown Campus across from
Springfield Park and between Bethel Baptist
and First Christian Science churches, a
locale rich with history. It was also chosen
to receive a 1991 Florida Preservation Award
for meritorious achievement in the rehabili‘
ration of a historic residential structure, from
the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.lf
you have friends visiting Jacksonville, you
might want to give Joe a call about the inn.
In days of old when knights were
bold...
Costumer extraordinaire Kitty Lapp (Fine
Arts) made an Elizabethan costume, circa
1585, and wore it to take part in
Jacksonville’s recently held Renaissance
Fair. Kitty just paraded around during this
fair which she likened to an Elizabethan
pleasure fair. She was joined by friend
Vicky Kissinger who was dressed as Queen
Elizabeth. The Renaissance Fair was a
Jacksonville “first,” sponsored by the city.
What an opportunity to meet your knight
in shining armor.
Some “dog”gone fun
We all know Dennis Pickrell (Informa—
tion Services) is hooked on Boxers (dogs
that 15!), but he now has a new “tail” to tell
us. Dennis has taken up photography of
dog shows and matches and has had several
photos published in various breed maga—
zines, including the national publication,
Boxer Review. Dennis invites everyone to
the Greater Orange Park Dog Club,
October 16 . 27, where there will be more
than 10 dog clubs on display. October 21 is
“puppy night,” with puppies of many
different breeds to pet and visit with. Be
. sure to trot on over and say hi to Dennis.
I love networking with everyone on all
the campuses. Remember! If you see me
.out pounding my beat and have a scoop for
me, just holler! How about you folks at
Kent Campus? Haven’t heard from you in
a long time.
