“It is good,’ ’ one woman said as she
tasted a bite of raw, peeled broccoli
stalk. Several heads nodded in agree-
ment as the plate was passed around
the table. “It’s like a bite of sweet
celery,” emphasized the instructor, Den—
nis Stewart. “We use up everything
when we cook.”
“For goodness sakes,” said another
woman, when Stewart described a
minced garlic and cheese sandwich, tas—
ty, good for warding off head colds, and
an economical way to fill a hot dog
bun. “It also helps you get to sleep,” he
said of the garlic.
The students are involved in an in—
novative Adult Basic Education class
developed and coordinated through
FCC].
Through a nontraditional teaching
strategy, the “Reading, ’Riting,
’Rithmetic and Recipes” course is
designed to enhance the education of
ABE students academically, nutritional—
ly and economically.
“This program serves the needs of
primarily low income adults who need
literacy training to also learn to plan
and prepare nutritious, attractive and
healthy meals on a low—cost budget,”
said Bob Wofford, program director.
“This class is really turning students on.”
Stewart agrees. “Before some of these
students came to the class, they said to
themselves, ‘He can’t teach me
anything.’ Now they can’t wait to get to
class.”
Stewart serves as a resource person for
the course which is offered at six senior
citizen nutrition centers in Jacksonville.
The first classes were offered in Oc—
tober, and approximately 150 women
and men are enrolled this winter. The
grant—funded program is scheduled to
last through June.
Stewart’s students benefit from the
class in various ways. “The students
have a better understanding of how
they should change their eating habits
to feel better. They enjoy the instruc—
tional part. I’m able to give them
natural cooking tips that tie in to their
age group.” ’
All of his students are senior citizens
and most of them have special con—
siderations, such as high blood pressure,
insomnia or diabetes. “This course gives
them a creative way to follow doctor’s
orders and prepare healthy meals.”
In addition to changes in food
preparation, Stewart sees his students’
mental attention span and verbal skills
improving.
Stewart also benefits from the ex—
perience. “I learn from them. They
learn from me. They tell me a lot of
folklore [such as cooking tips] handed
down from their parents and grand—
parents.”
The program was developed as a
team effort by Wofford, assistant dean
of the ABE department, advisor
Deborah Bell, curriculum developer
Sara Lovetter, and Stewart.
FCCJ’s Open Campus TV production
team of Steve McNally, Jon Koob,
Mark Abbott and Ed Coker created
nine instructional cooking videos to be
used in the package, to be run in-
dependently (such as on the FCC]
channel), and to be made available for
statewide distribution.
