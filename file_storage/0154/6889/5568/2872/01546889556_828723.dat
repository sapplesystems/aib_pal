Nursing professors perform an “Operation”
in Saudi Arabia
It’s been a little over a year since Saddam
Hussein and his band of Iraqi soldiers fired
the first shots on Kuwait.
The dictator’s actions predicated a series
of events which glued millions around the
world to their radios and television sets.
Of course, thousands of individuals got a
much more personal View of the war,
including North Campus nursing professors
Angeline Jenkins and Denise Figueroa, who
returned from Operation Desert Storm five
months ago.
Lt. Col. Angeline Jenkins
Nothing could have prepared Angeline
Jenkins for what she saw as part of Opera—
tion Desert Storm.
A 12—year veteran of the United States
Army Reserves, Jenkins was well trained, as
both a nurse and a soldier. But she never
thought she would have to use that knowl’
edge.
“I knew that when I was sworn in that I
could be called to go to war at anytime,” she
said. “But a lot of us thought it would never
happen.”
For the 300&#39;plus members of the 345th,
Combat Support Hospital Unit their desire
to “make a difference” became a grim reality
in November 1990 when they were placed
on military alert. Within a month, the unit
was activated, for the first time in its histo—
ry, and sent to Ft. Stewart, GA for chemi—
cal warfare training before being deployed to
Saudi Arabia.
“That’s when the anxiety really started
taking over,” Jenkins said. “For the first
time, we started realizing that we may not
be coming&#39;back.”
On the morning of January 14 the
members of the 345th touched down in
Saudi Arabia, eventually setting up camp
just outside the capital of Rijadh.
As a combat support hospital, the 345th’s
primary responsibility was to assist other
hospitals. “We can treat up to 200 patients,
but we never reached more than 50%
guidance maven:
Members of the 312th Evacuation Hospital Unit take
occupancy at any time,” Jenkins said. “We
were blessed to have gotten as few [patients]
as we did.”
In addition to treating the sick and
injured, while protecting themselves,
members of the 345th had to contend with
the weather conditions. “It was unbearably
hot during the day—sometimes reaching
118 degrees—and chilly at night,” she said.
“There were sand storms where we had to
worry about our tents blowing over.”
But even more difficult, according to
Jenkins, was being separated from family and
friends. “It was very hard to have to leave
my home and my work. And there were
times when I questioned my decision [to
join the Reserves], but I drew on my inner
strength to did what I needed to do,” she
said. &#39;
Despite the physical and emotional rigors
of war, Jenkins is glad things turned out the
way they did. She learned some lessons
about herself, made some lifelong friends
and gained professional experience most
nurses will never know. “It’s been difficult
readjusting, but I know I’m’ better for having
been there.”
1st Lt. Denise Figueroa
Denise Figueroa joined the Army
Reserves out of respect for the military
personnel. After returning from Saudi
Arabia as part of Operation Desert Storm,
she has become one of the respected herself.
Figueroa, an adjunct professor at North
Campus, had been in the Reserves less than
a year when she received a call that the
345th was being placed on active duty. The
following weeks flew by with a “feverish
pitch,” she said.
Like Jenkins, Figueroa. trained at Ft.
Stewart, but a week before the 345th was
scheduled to deploy, she was transferred to
the 312th Evacuation Hospital Unit based
in South Carolina.
Within a matter of weeks, the 312th also
received its orders to Saudi Arabia. “Of

course we weren’t happy about going, but
the most difficult part was not knowing
when we would be coming back,” she said.
“Having to leave my husband and children
was also very traumatic.” And it didn’t help.
that the unit landed in Saudi Arabia on
January 20——Figueroa’s birthday.
Once there, the 312th quickly built a
400&#39;bed hospital, just 17 miles from Kuwait
and 13 miles from Iraq.
“In three months we treated more than
12,000 patients. We took all sick call
soldiers and treated hundreds of injuries—
United States and British troops, Iraqi
civilians and Iraqi prisoners,” she said.
“Most people don’t understand how many
injuries there were. We were busy 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.”
Not that Figueroa was complaining...
“Being so busy kept us focused. Having so
many patients to take care of kept our
minds off other things,&quot; she said. And
being in a war zone, that wasn’t an easy
task.
“When we first arrived, there were
SCUD attacks, so we spent our first week in
chemical suits,&quot; she recalled. “We tried to
spend time sleeping during the day because
the SCUD attacks started about 6 o’clock
every night; It’s hard to sleep with explo—
sions going off all night.”
Looking back, going to war wasn’t
exactly the birthday present Figueroa had
been hoping for, but she now realizes she
received a more meaningful gift. “I was able
to make a difference. People were injured,
and we were able to help them,&quot; she said. “I
definitely think l-accomplished my goal.”
Before Jenkins and Figueroa rejoin the
nursing faculty this fall, they would like to
thank the faculty, staff and students of FCC],
particularly North Campus, for their
overwhelming support throughout the war.
“That has meant more to us than anything,”
Jenkins said. “It’s something that is going to
stay with me for a long time.&quot;
     
  
 
Kent Campus comes up with the
green
Roosevelt Boulevard is getting a facelift,
thanks in part to the students at Kent
Campus.
Students and staff contributed almost
$500, matched by funds from the FCCJ
Foundation, Inc., to a Roosevelt Boulevard
tree planting project. The project, devel&#39;
oped by Greenscape, planted 250 green ash
trees in the median of Roosevelt between

“Kent Campus wanted to support the
good work of Greenscape and did so by
raising this money,” said Charles Dassance,
provost of Kent Campus.
Greenscape plans to continue its
“beautification of Jacksonville” through
projects in the San Marco area.
Cook elected Board chair
The members of District Board of Trustees
recently elected Betty P. Cook as chair of-
the Board for 1991—1992.
“Betty has served longer than any other
Board member in College history, and I
think the perfect way to reward her service
to FCCJ is to elect her as the first woman
chair,” Joy M. Jones said in her nomination
remarks. Cook, who is also the first Nassau
resident to hold the office of Board
chairman, was elected unanimously and
rather expediently, prompting President
Charles Spence to remark, “Let the minutes
note that the voting took only five seconds.”
In response, Cook said, “I want to
congratulate the governor, cabinet and
Senate for their good judgment in choosing
Board members with such diversity and
individualism,” she said. “May we function
with a strong sense of fairness and openness
to the interest of the people we serve.”
Jones was revelected as chair of Nassau
County and John A. Wiggins was elected as
chair of Duval County.
FCCJ telecourses hit the big time
FCCJ’s production of quality telecourses has
landed the College its first national con—
tract for distribution. The Public Broad&#39;
casting System has received the rights to
market and distribute “Read, Write and
Research,” ENC 1102, nationally, as well as
in Mexico and Canada. PBS is already pro—
moting the availability of ENC 1102, which
is 24 segments long and was produced by
the Open Campus media production
department. Prior to the signing of the PBS
contract, FCC] had already arranged for
distribution with several other educational
outlets. Kathy Clower, media production
manager for FCCJ, is excited about the
prospect of such Widespread exposure.
“We are obviously very pleased. It is
very gratifying to receive national exposure
with our first major venture,&quot; she said. “I
think we have a project we can all
celebrate!”
FCCJ’s Open Campus media production
department, which produced the 24
segments, also secured the second in a series
of contracts to shoot and edit two sets of
instructional video tapes to accompany
algebra books currently under revision by
Prentice Hall.
