In the first nine months of the plan, 26

said President Charles Spence. “Last year,
we decided to tackle an issue public organi—
zations have recently struggled with—the
challenge of increasing business with
minorityaowned enterprises.”
Though conventional thinking says that
minority owned businesses are unable to
compete in a free market for public projects
and public dollars, FCC] has committed
itself and its resources to reaching out to
these often overlooked groups. The most
recent results of the College’s minority
vendor usage plan proves that FCC] is
certainly on the right track.
“FCC]’s staff has responded very well to
the challenge [of soliciting minority busi’
nesses],” said Larry Snell, director of
purchasing. “By creating an astute awareness
of the problem, we have been able to
concentrate our efforts to give every
opportunity to reach out to and assist
minority businesses.”

Trustees approve
mall location
While many consumers look to their
local shopping mail for bargains, FCC]’s
District Board of Trustees is finding that the
best bargain is the shopping mall itself.
At its September meeting, the Board gave
unanimous approval for the College to begin
negotiations to purchase the Grande Boulevard
Mall and surrounding property, worth an
estimated $6.5 million, for $3.75 million.
“I think it’s going to be very creative,&quot;
Trustee Teala Milton told The Florida
Times’Union about the purchase. “Our
children have been brought up shopping in
malls and they feel comfortable there.”
Purchase of the mall, which would increase
instructional space from 15,000 to 117,000
square feet, would alleviate crowded class,
rooms brought on by an almost 50 percent
enrollment increase in the last five years.
More space, in turn, would allow the College
to expand its offerings and better serve
southeast ]acksonville, considered to be the
fastest growing area in Duval County,
according to the Times—Union. Such a center
would be less expensive and more convenient
to put into operation than FCCJ’s future
Southeast campus. Though it would also be
faster, College administrators are quick to
note that the setvup of Grande Boulevard
Mall is still a long way off.
In addition to the purchase price, the
College could spend an additional $3.75
million for a parking garage and $8.4 million
for classroom equipment and renovations.
These costs (including purchase), however,
would be only half the cost of building a
new facility.
A preliminary feasibility study, recently
completed by Reynolds, Smith and Hills,
Inc. and the Department of Education
determined that the mall could be made to
conform with state educational facility
specifications; however, a number of
additional items and conditions must be met
prior to actual purchase. FCC] has submit!
ted its plan to the state and is currently
awaiting approval.
celebrate its successful implementation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
throughout October.
“We have made a commitment to serve
our disabled population—employees and
students—to the best of our ability. But
unlike other institutions, we don’t just talk
about it,” said Jeff Oliver, assistant dean of
student affairs for disabled student services.
“With one of the largest disabled student
services programs in the state, we have put
our money where our mouth is.”
Signed into law by President George Bush
in 1990, the ADA “guarantees disabled
people access to employment, public accomt
modations, transportation, public services and
telecommunications.&quot; Each of these five areas
is covered by a different section of the act
with affected entities required to make
necessary provisions by the dates established.
To ensure FCC]’s full compliance, the
College has established an ADA committee.
Chaired by Executive Vice President Ed
Napier, the committee provides ongoing
supervision of all College programs, services,
facilities and employment practices with
regard to ADA. Additionally, an ADA task
force, chaired by Oliver, reviews the ADA
and advises appropriate College administrav
tors how the law relates to their areas of
responsibility and the needs to be addressed.
The formation of the ADA committee
and task force is typical of FCC]’s dedica&#39;
tion to its disabled population, according to
Oliver. “Every employee and student—no
matter what their disability—will be
provided the appropriate assistance and will
be mainstreamed to the maximum of our
ability,” he said. “The ADA committee
guarantees that we are doing just that.”
Oliver hopes to carry ADA&#39;s message of
equality for people with disabilities through;
out October. Wheelchair obstacle courses and
blindfolded bowling are two activities that
will be offered at campus health fairs to
promote awareness of the disabled. Indepena
dent Living for Adult Blind (ILAB) will also
host Vision Awareness Day, Oct. 13 when
local politicians (including Steve Wise, Kathy
Chinoy and Matt Carlucci) don blindfolds
and “go blind for a day.”
“We want to sensitize and inform faculty,
staff and students of the nature of disabili‘
ties and of ADA,” he said. “We want them
to know that we didn’t implement ADA
just because we had to but because it’s
morally right.”
