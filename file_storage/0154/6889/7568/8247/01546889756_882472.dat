Annual meeting ap-
plauds FCCJ’s future
“To say education is important is putting
it mildly,” Monica Mehan told attendees at
the FCC] Foundation’s annual meeting.
Mehan, who was recently named president
and CEO of AT&amp;T Transtech, recalled
getting her start at a community college.
“I earned my associate’s degree in
computer science in the late ’605 while
working for AT&amp;T as a computer clerk,”
she said. “More than 20 years later, I’m still
learning about the value of education.”
Over the years, Mehan worked her way

through the ranks, holding a variety of staff
assignments in data operations and systems
development. In 1988 she was appointed
director of customer accounts program
management—largely due to her on—going
educational pursuits. “The range of
continuing education opportunities almost
makes it impossible for people to say they
are educated enough,” she said.
Community colleges, like FCC], are an
integral part of the educational process,
according to Mehan. “The value of
educational services that FCC] provides is
wonderful,” she said. “And I look forward to
a close working relationship with FCC].”
Foundation members, who received
copies of the Foundation’s annual report,
also got a glimpse into the future with a
PATHWAY 2000 presentation by College
President Charles Spence.
Provosts become
campus presidents
In an attempt to more accurately reflect
the administrative responsibilities of FCCJ’s
provosts, the District Board of Trustees
unanimously approved a title change from
provost to campus president.
According to the administrative recom’
mendation, “individuals serving as campus
heads at FCC] deserve to hold a title com—
mensurate with their positions based on
national norms.” Furthermore, individuals
who hold the title of provost are at a distinct
disadvantage with peers in competitive career
advancement. The title campus president,
then, would increase the College’s effective—
ness in national recruiting efforts by attracting
more qualified applicants for open positions.
College President Charles Spence said
that the change only makes sense. ”Many
presidents of small community colleges,
including multi’campus schools, have less
responsibility than our provosts. In fact,
some of these schools have fewer students
than just one of our campuses,” he told the
Board. “It’s only fair that our provosts be
given a title that encompasses their admin~
istrative roles on their campuses.”
Florida Legislature
digs for G.O.L.D.
FCCJ’s Lifelong Learning program will
undergo some changes as a result of a recent
bill passed by the Florida Legislature.
According to a memo from the Florida
Department of Education, “the Vocational
Consolidation bill changed the language
which addresses lifelong learning to address
community social and economic issues
related to health and human relations,
government, parenting, consumer econom—
ics and senior citizens.”
Currently, leisure and enrichment
courses offered by Golden Opportunity for
Lifelong Learning (G.O.L.D.) and Lifelong
Learning programs are targeted to senior
citizens. As a result of the new bill, the
program will be expanded to include other
segments of the community. Though
afternoon and evening workshops and
campus—based wellness/exercise classes are
being added to accomplish this task, plans
have been in the works for some time.
“The direction of lifelong learning is
changing, and FCC] began preparing early
for the change,&quot; said Delphia Williams,
G.O.L.D. and Lifelong Learning programs
project coordinator. “We began making
plans for interesting community events
that adhere to the new definition when we
first heard about the bill.&quot;
State and community college leaders are
currently meeting to discuss the major
changes in the definition of lifelong
learning as defined by the Legislature. The
definition will not immediately affect
existing lifelong learning courses; current
classes are protected until May 1993, the
end of this academic year.
South Campus has its
palm read
Students and faculty at FCC]’s South
Campus will study the lifeline of a palm
this winter, but it has nothing to do with
fortune tellers.
A south Florida tree company planted a
$3,000 palm tree in the Palm Garden of
South Campus to learn how this species
would react to the North Florida climate.
“We think it will do quite well since it
probably will not have to endure any
extended freezing temperatures,&quot; said Ann
Billings, vice president of Groundworks of
Palm Beach County, Inc. in Boynton
Beach, Fla. “We’re looking forward with
optimism to see what happens.”
The tree is a special strain of the
phoenix dactylifera called the madjool date
palm. The madjool date, according to
Billings, is one of the most valuable
varieties of dates. Billings said that these
trees are popular in parts of Arizona and
California and are becoming very popular
in South Florida. The company donated
the tree to FCC].
“It was given to us with the provision
that we not do anything to protect it from
weather,” said Earl Farris, FCC] assistant
dean of humanities and fine arts. “Our job
is to watch it, enjoy it and let it live or die
according to the will of nature.”
South Campus now boasts about 50
species of palm trees in its garden, according
to Farris, who is one of its unofficial keepers.
Farris said that with so many species in the
garden, it is a valuable outdoor laboratory for
FCC] students.
 
College employees
receive thanks
from Miami-Dado
When the people of South Florida
struggled to go on with their lives
following the destruction of Hurricane
Andrew, thousands of North Florida
residents pitched in. Hospitals sent
doctors and nursese to attend to the
injured. Supermarkets sent truckloads of
food to feed the hungry. Local citizens
contributed money, clothes and
building supplies.
Two FCC] employees, however,
gave something even more valuable——
their time and expertise.
Jerry Lewis, adviser II, South
Campus, and John Wordsman, adviser
II, Kent, traveled to storm—ravaged
Miami to assist Miami&#39;Dade Commu—
nity College students with their
financial aid needs. In repsonse to their
contributions, Martin Fine, chairman,
district board of trustees, and Robert
McCabe, president, sent this letter of
thanks to FCC] District Board of
Trustees Chairman Wesley Poole.

Dear Mr. Poole:
helping us rebuild.

As you know, Miami-Dade Community College was days away from beginning its
Fall
term when Hurricane Andrew raged across South Florida on August 24. In its
wake,
Andrew left behind nearly $20 billion in property damages and shattered the
lives of
tens of thousands in Dade County. By the measurement of property damage,
the
hurricane was the most costly peacetime disaster in American history.
Our earliest assessments required us to delay opening until mid-September.
More than
500 college staff suffered severe damage or loss of their homes. Thousands
of our
students and their families faced similar circumstances. Although all of
our ﬁve
campuses were damaged, most of our physical plant problems were at our two
southern
most facilities--Kendall and Homestead. Every building on the Kendall
campus was
damaged and all of our classroom facilities at Homestead were destroyed.
We are now several weeks into the Fall term, a point arrived at with a
great deal of
help from Florida&#39;s education community. We extend a special thanks to
Jerry Lewis
and John Wordsman, of Florida Community College at Jacksonville, for giving
us their
time and ﬁnancial aid expertise. Their efforts kept hurricane-affected
students in
college who would have otherwise dropped out beeause of ﬁnancial need.
On behalf of the entire family of Miami-Dade Community College, thank you
for
Mil/W
Robert H. McCabe
President
