Statistics show approximately 40,000
college students play football each year.
Of those 40,000, only 13,000 are eligi—
ble to be drafted by a professional team,
and then only 110 of those players sign
major pro contracts each year. The
statistics are nearly the same for profes-
sional basketball and baseball. Yet,
while these statistics may seem startling,
thousands and thousands of youths
spend the majority of their time refin-
ing their athletic skills in pursuit of col—
legiate, Olympic or professional sports
careers that are not guaranteed, while
allowing their education to fall by the
wayside. This dilemma was described in
detail by a recent visitor to FCCJ,
whose career in professional football
has evolved into a new kind of “coaching.”
Isaiah M. Hipp, former NFL player, is
now chairman of Career Perspective
Enterprises. For two days Hipp visited
with administrators, faculty and
members of the coaching staff to review
and advise the College’s intercollegiate
athletic program in regards to
academics, counseling, scholarships and
the retention and graduation of
athletes. He also spoke with FCCJ
athletes about “life after sports.”
“Our goal at Career Perspectives is
not to deter the student athletes’ dream
of a professional career,” said Hipp. “We
just want to create the realism of what
may happen to them ten years down
the road after the dream has faded. I’ve
seen too many ex—athletes sitting in bars
telling stories of what used to be. Our
kids need to be prepared for life, not
just playing ball. This is why a good
education is important.”
Hipp’s visit was a joint effort between
Student Activities, the Black Student
Success Office and the Athletic Depart—
ment. “There has been a concern with
the success rate of our student athletes

Witherspoon says different efforts have
been made to address the special con-
cerns of student athletes, but nothing is
formally being done. “In order to in—
crease the success rate of our athletes
we must make formal changes in our
structural services, such as counseling
and academic advising. We are looking
to Career Perspectives to help us with
this,” he said.

student athletes is becoming a major
concern of the administration and
coaching staffs of most colleges and
universities. Many of them have set
policy that prohibits a failing athlete
from competing. The National Col—
legiate Athletic Association has also im‘
posed strict guidelines that monitor the
academic success of athletes. If an
athlete does not meet the minimum re—
quirements, he or she is suspended un-
til progress is made or ruled ineligible
to play.
These efforts have proven to be we
cessful and should be commended. But
Hipp says that the importance of educa—
tion should be stressed to students as
early as elementary school. “We should
teach children that they should strive to
be the best at all they can, not just
athletics. It’s important that they
develop good self-esteem and know how
to set priorities,” said Hipp. “I know
several football and baseball players
who had successful athletic careers and
are now successful businessmen. That’s
because they prepared themselves for
the future.”
Sylvester Mayers, a student at Arizona
Western Community College, visited
FCCJ with Hipp and told of his own
personal experience. Mayers aspired to
play college football at Clemson Univer—
sity, but his grades were not acceptable.
He then opted to attend a community
college to improve his academic record
and was also able to play football. “I
looked at it as a second chance to prove
myself. I said it’s not over, I can still do
what I always dreamed of doing,” said
Mayers. “My message to student
athletes is to make the best of your col—
lege years. Take classes that will help
you out in life later. Don’t take just
anything to stay eligible, because there
are no guarantees.”
