Arborfest 992 is a tree-mendous success
 
 
Money earned at the annual tree and plant sale will be used for upkeep and
new projects at the
Wilding Arboretum.
Webster may call it “a place where trees,
shrubs and herbaceous plants are cultivated
for scientific purposes,” but to local resir
dents, the Wilding Arboretum, located on
Kent Campus, is much more than that.
“It’s really a magical place,” said Prissy
Bowers, longtime member and former
president of the Wilding Garden Club. “It’s
a place where people can come to learn, to
enjoy the beauty of nature or just to relax.”
The Wilding Arboretum was “born&quot; four
years ago, due largely to the work of Provost
Charles Dassance. “Before Dr. Dassance

College security department measures up
During the past decade, college campuses
throughout the nation have increasingly been the
site of personal and violent crime. The
increased reporting of campus crime and
violence in the media has raised concerns among
parents, campus administrators and lawmakers
about the safety of our college campuses.
(“FCCJ Campus Security Report,” 1991)
While these words were written last year,
they seem even more appropriate today.
Though safety has always been of para—
mount importance at FCC], College staff
and students have been questioning lately
how safe they really are.
In the wake of recent highlyrpublicized
events, including a student assault on
Downtown Campus, the Career Employees
Council prepared a resolution regarding
security issues. The resolution, which CEC
plans to present to the District Board of
Trustees, calls for a number of security
measures including “additional security
personnel during peak times” (i.e. registra—
tion) and “monitoring of security cameras at
all times.”
Curlene Denson, adviser at Downtown
Campus and CEC president, said that a
public statement of this kind was necessary
to raise awareness. “We aren’t trying to
alarm anyone, but instead establish precau—
tions and offer some suggestions,” she said.
CEC’s suggestions, in conjunction with
came to the campus, we had a small wild—
flower garden behind one of the buildings
[on campus]. But the kind of flowers we
had, people just thought it was a patch of
weeds,” Bowers said. ,
Building on the idea of bringing nature to
the people, Dassance suggested that an
unused space—approximately one acre,
located just inside the campus grounds—be
used for educational purposes.
“We worked with the Wilding Garden
Club to develop a teaching vehicle where
local residents could come and learn about

recent self—imposed security measures, have
been met with favorable results on
FCCJ’s campuses.
According to Jim Jett, chief of safety and
security, flexible scheduling has put addi—
tional security guards on duty during peak
hours and also prevents the dispatching
console from ever being unstaffed. All
officers are being required to undergo 40
hours of additional training at the Jackson
ville Sheriff’s Office Police Training Center
on South Campus and are being encouraged
to patrol College grounds more aggressively.
Parabolic mirrors and supplemental outdoor
lighting are also in the works—if not already

,“What was particularly shocking about the
plants that are native to our area. The
Wilding Arboretum is now the only
arboretum in the city,” Dassance said.
In celebration of the project and Florida
Arbor Day, Kent Campus and the Wilding
Garden Club organized Arborfest. Insti’
tuted in 1990, Arborfest’s purpose is to raise
awareness, according to Dassance. “The
arboretum has been here for years, but a lot
of people still don’t know about it,&quot; he said.
“We want to expose
[residents] to the
arboretum and felt
that this type of
event would be the
best way to do it.”

Arborfest attendees became Native Americans
for the day, thanks to Gator Clowns who
provided face painting.
This year’s event, which boasted a
Native American theme, featured Native
American dances and song, provided by the
Order of the Arrow, and the Creek Indian
Show, presented by Jimmy Sawgrass. Gator
Clowns were on hand for Indian face
painting, and St. John’s Wildlife brought its
petting 200.
“Though we want people of all ages to
come out, the activities are oriented toward
kids. We want to expose them to education
[through the arboretum] and felt that this
type of event would be the best way to do
it,” Dassance said.
Bowers was pleased with the number of
children and parents who braved the chilly
weather to take part in the celebration.
She was similarly impressed with the
Wilding Garden Club’s tree and plant sale.
Apparently, the weather wasn’t the only
thing that was brisk.

completed—on several campuses.
“To commit a crime, a person needs
desire, capability and opportunity,” said
Feliche Mucciolo, crime prevention officer.
“If we can eliminate the opportunity, then
we can control some of the crimes.&quot;
In addition to issues of staffing and
visibility, CEC also recommended improved
communication between security and staff. “T ocommit&#39; a crime,
a person needs desire,
capability and
opportunity. If we
caneliminate the
opportunity, then we

student assault was that most employees
didn’t learn of it from security or adminis&#39;
tration; they heard about it on the news,”
Denson said. ”’
Though Jett and Mucciolo agree that
communication is essential to crime pre—
vention, many times it isn’t possible.
“More often than not, we are not at liberty
to discuss incidents. If there is an ongoing
investigation where the Sheriffs Office is
involved, we simply can’t talk about it,”
Jett added.
Despite legal restrictions, Jett and staff
are doing what they can to make students
and staff feel secure on FCCJ’s campuses.
“We want to make this College as safe as we
can. But we know we aren’t perfect,” he
said. “We are always open to suggestions,
so if you see something that needs improve&#39;
ment, let us know.

issues, call Jim Jett or Feliche Mucciolo at
