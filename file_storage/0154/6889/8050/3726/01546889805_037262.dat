February is a favorite month of mine. I
guess I’m an eternal romantic. (Maybe that
has something to do with the fact that I was
born in February and Aquarius are known
somewhat to be “bleeding hearts”) Neverthev
less, I love hearing romantic stories with
happy endings and hope to share some of
those with you along with other “scoops.”
Nurse proves to be best man
for the job
Angie O’Bryant (Nursing) called me
with a scoop about a student of hers. The
story fits in perfectly for Valentine’s Day.
Arthur Gladden, an FCCJ nursing student,
recently took care of a patient at a local
hospital for the better part of a week. He
did such a good job that the patient not
only invited him to his wedding but asked
him to serve as best man. Now that’s what I
call above and beyond the call of duty. A
nice ending all around.
Hearts and ﬂowers in any language
Tmnce
With so many employees on so many
different schedules, it’s not always easy for
cupid to shoot his arrow and reach his
target. In the case of Kathy Rizk and Rich
Dolder (English as a Second Language),
however, cupid hit the mark. Kathy and
Rich are both instructors in the ESL
department and found they had much more
in common than the love of teaching
English to new Americans. They fell in love
with each other and recently were married.
There are so many stories within the ESL
program that tug at the heartstrings, and I
hope we see many more happy endings like
this within the ollege.
Running for the pass
Margot Martin (English, Downtown) is
a member of an all—female group that gets
together to play touch football every
Sunday. She recently showed up to teach
her classes a little worse for the wear.
According to Margot, another woman
literally ran over her on the football field,
and Margot bit right through her bottom
lip. Her injury required stitches. Imagine
the look on the face of the attending
physician in the emergency room when she
said it was a football injury. Wish I had
been there to see that reaction!
Over the bounding main
Downtown Campus has another group of
out&#39;of—the&#39;ordinary women. Anne Banas
(Art, Downtown), Jean Riddle (Mathemat—
ics, Downtown) and Carolyn Maynard
(Art, Downtown) put together their all
women crew and entered a 28—foot Hunter
sailboat in the Annual Hunter SailaIn at
Whitney’s Marina. It’s an annual event
where owners of Hunter sailboats get
together and put on this sailvin event. I bet
they’d even be able to hold their own in the
days of old when pirate ships sailed the seas.
Even macho men get restless
If anyone thinks soap opera fans are
women only, better think again. Sgt.
Thomas Yorton (Security, Downtown) and
Ozzie White (Boat upholstery, Geis
Marine) are super fans of “The Young and
the Restless.” They even tape the daily
segments to watch at home to keep up with
the storyline. There are also other “closet”
male fans that we won’t mention. So much
for soap opera watching being a wimpy
pastime! Believe me, they don’t come any
more manly or courageous than Tom
Yorton. Just 20 days after having his leg
amputated, Tom is once again back on the
security force with his usual bright smile ,
and positive attitude. Nothing can stop
him. What an inspiration!
Roger to the rescue
In keeping with Valentine’s Day and to
prove that chivalry is not dead (maybe just
asleep), Roger Breen (Mathematics, Grande
Boulevard Mall) came to the rescue of a
stranded student. The FCC] College Center
at Grande Boulevard Mall recently had its
bathrooms renovated. Apparently one of the
students got locked in and couldn’t get out
until, you guessed it, Roger came to the
rescue. (What happened to the good old days
when you could crawl out under the door?) I
guess that’s what happens when you attend a
fancy center like Florida Community College
at Jacobson’s.
I wish all of you a lovely Valentine’s Day
with lots of hearts and ﬂowers. Just know
you’re all my special valentines.
