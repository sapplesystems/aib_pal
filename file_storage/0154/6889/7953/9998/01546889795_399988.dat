ENTERTAiNMENT
Budget department employee inspires
a 6miracle on Broad Street’
It may seem like a strange twist of fate, but
Marsha Dasaro, administrative assistant III in
the budget department, came up with the idea
to help others at the Martin Center’s Annual
Bah—Humbug Party. At the party, which is
hosted by the department who did the least to
decorate during the previous Christmas,
Dasaro decided that she wanted her depart—
ment to do something different to avoid
winning the dreaded Bah‘l-Iumbug Award.
“Our Christmas decorations were really
the pits; they’re all ragged and beat/up. But I
didn’t want to spend a dime of my hard
earned money on decorations, especially
when there are so many hungry people out
there,” she said.
What Dasaro came up with—the “can
tree”—would not only be a unique decora—
tion, but, more importantly, it would help
the needy in Jacksonville.
“When we put the tree up, before
Thanksgiving, it was strictly for this
department. I figured that if everyone in our
area gave just one can per week, we would
be able to make a nice contribution to the
Food Bank,&quot; she said. “But then everyone
started participating. People from all over
the building were bringing cans to me; I
even received boxes of macaroni and cheese
through innereoffice mail.”
The overwhelming response of the
College allowed Dasaro to also contribute to
the Business Partners Project, an organiza’
tion that matches local businesses and
institutions with needy Jacksonville
children. FCCJ’s ‘adopted’ child, Michael, is
10 years old and in fourth grade at Andrew
Robinson Elementary School.
“This is what the holidays are all about,
helping others, letting people know that
they are valuable and special,” Dasaro said.
“And being able to see the results of our
efforts makes it so much more meaningful.”
The project became even more meaning;
ful when Michael and his fellow students
decided to return the favor. “The children
learned that we gave up our decoration
money to buy canned goods. They didn’t
want us to win the Bah‘Humbug Award, so
they made decorations for us,” Dasaro said.
The children’s handiwork, which covered
the walls of the budget, finance, payroll and
purchasing offices, couldn’t have been a
more appropriate way to decorate.
“This project was just one way that FCCJ
can help the community in which we are

located,” she said. “I like that level of
involvement between the College and the
community. And hopefully it is not some—
thing that lasts just for one holiday. We want
it to continue throughout the year.”
College architect builds hopes and dreams
The recent opening of the South
Campus Child Development Center was a
sea of smiling faces. Students and staff were
delighted to have a daycare facility located on
campus. Four— and fiveeyear’olds were elated
to have a new place to play. Campus Presi—
dent Joan Hill was
 
    
happy to be able to
meet South Campus’
growing needs. But
perhaps no one was
more thrilled than
Keith Kelly, College
architect, who
designed the building.

for the College. “According to my job
description, I am responsible for designing
facilities which are a certain amount of
money; anything over that amount is
designed by outside architectural firms. And
we don’t often build facilities that fall in my
category,” he said. “Being able to actually do
so was really exciting.&quot;
While much of the building’s appearance
was mandated by educational specifications,
Kelly had other design elements to consider.
“I wanted the building to have a residential
appearance so the children could relate to it,&quot;
he said. “I also wanted it to be ‘child scale’ as
much as possible. The sheltering roof, for
example, is built in such a way that it appears
more child size.&quot;
Overall, Kelly said he is pleased with the way
the Center turned out. “And anything that
involves children is always a pleasant experience.”
