Minority Outreach
program surpasses
expectations
In December 1990 College President
Charles Spence initiated the Minority
Outreach program in hopes of increasing the
opportunity for minority businesses to
participate in FCC]’s bidding process. He
knew the potential for growth was there, but
he had no idea how successful the program
would become.
In its first year under the program, FCC]
has increased its total minority awards
(construction and non/construction) by
$1,455,514 or 759 percent (see chart). “In
the last year, we have made tremendous
strides toward increasing business with
minority‘owned enterprises,” Spence said.
“And we are fortunate to be able to share
our success with the minority businesses.&quot;
This success is even more impressive
when compared with other institutions.
While FCC] awards more than 10 percent of
its total College contracts (measured in
dollars) to minority businesses, the city of
Jacksonville and the United States Post
Office award approximately 1 percent and 3
percent respectively.
Larry Snell, director of purchasing, said
that the College will continue to work with
minority businesses to continue the progress.
“As we enter our second year [of the
Minority Outreach program] we are con!
tinuing to identify numerous new minority
business enterprises and extending the same
equal opportunity to all businesses,” he said.
“The cooperation throughout the College
has made the program successful and we
look forward to an even better second year.”

Spreading the word
about GED
You might hear it on the radio. You
might read it in the newspaper or see it on
the side of a bus. You might even see it in a
movie theater before the feature presentav
tion. The 1993 Great GED Awareness
Campaign is everywhere.
In conjunction with the Florida Depart—
ment of Education, FCC]’s adult studies
department is in the midst of a publicity
blitz to increase the number of students
taking the General Education Development
test. Between January and ]une 1993, FCC]
will try to increase its figures 10 percent over
last year’s during the same period.
“We are doing what we can to let
everybody know that the GED test is
available at FCC],” said Paula Miller,
assistant dean of operations for adult studies.
In addition to heightened publicity, the
number of testing dates and locations have
also been increased.
As a result of 1992’s Great GED Aware—
ness Campaign, 1,336 students took the
GED exam at FCC]. This year’s goal is
1,470 students.
College sets one—day
registration record
When FCC]’s student affairs and business
office employees reported to work on ]an. 5,
the last day to register without a late fee,
they thought they knew what to expect.
Having registered a total of 3,233 students
that same day in 1992, they figured it
couldn’t be any worse.
They were wrong.
By 10 p.m., they had registered 3,727
students.
Norma Blankenbaker, enrollment
services officer at South Campus, said, in
her 15 years with the College, she doesn’t
recall seeing so many students going through
registration in one day. “It was incredible!
By the end of the day, we had registered
1,094 students,&quot; she said. “We knew we
were in for a long haul.”
The lastvminute phenomenon continued
across FCC] with Kent registering 1,003
students, North‘556, Downtownr563,
Nassau—80 and the College Center at
Grande Boulevard Mall&#39;431.
Despite this being the largest single‘day
registration in three years, the process went
smoothly, according to Pat Hannan, director
of Grande Boulevard Mall. “With only
seven people working in the office, we were
very Shorthanded. We were able to get
through it, however, since we are all cross—
trained in all areas of registration,” she said.
“The students were also patient and very
understanding which helped a lot.”
]erry Patterson, dean of student affairs at
South Campus, was pleased with the process
as well. “We knew it would be a ‘big day,’ so
we had taken measures to ensure that
students would be taken care of as quickly
and efficiently as possible,” he said. A
number system, for one, eliminated standing
in line and allowed students to relax, use the
campus facilities or even leave campus until
it was time for them to register.
“For the first time, we also added an open
class list that scrolled through the classes
that were still open and how many seats
were still available, which enabled them to
have their classes selected and written on
their registration card when they entered
the registration area,” Patterson said.
“Student response to this new system was
quite positive.”
All in all, it was an extremely successful
registration, according to Patterson, and the
staff is to be congratulated for their hard
work. “It all comes down to teamwork.
Everything went so smoothly because we
had the cooperation of all areas—records,
financial aid, the business office, counseling,
administration,” he said. “And that’s really
the only way to make it work.”
‘The Doctor is in’ on
your campus or center
In an attempt to better understand the
needs of FCC] students, faculty and staff, “The
Doctor is in” program was created. Through
out the Winter ‘93 Term, College President
Charles Spence will be visiting each of the
College’s campuses and centers to answer
questions about College policies, activities or
operations and listen to suggestions.
