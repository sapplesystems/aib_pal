Barry Weber (Math) never saw a moun—
tain for the first 21 years of his life,
having grown up in the ﬂat farmlands
of Michigan; but when he did, it was
love at first sight. Now he tries to take
a trip each year to pursue his hobby of
photographing mountains. He and new
bride, Libby Leet, share this love of
photography. It was actually Libby that
got Barry interested in photography.
Opposites may attract, but common inr
terests sure keep things ﬂowing.
New production line
I know this is springtime and every-
thing is in bloom, but I sure didn’t ex-
pect both people who work with me to
“bloom” at the same time. Just proves
what a productive department Public
Affairs is. Van Wells is expecting in
August and Janet Dickey in September.
Can you imagine having both your staff
members on maternity leave at the
same time? What are the odds of that? I
feel like I’m going to be a grandma!
Growing old gracefully
It was great fun taping a segment for
“The Jacksonville Connection” at the
Singleton Center for Seniors. What an
active place. Here we were recording
and in the background all you could
hear was “B52, N29, ...” The bingo
game was booming. At the same time
an exercise class was dancing to music
while two gentlemen were playing ping
pong. I think it’s terrific to have a
facility like that to offer so many
healthy and happy activities for our
seniors. Can’t wait until I can join
them.
Reservations about reservations
If you’re looking for hotel reservations,
please DON’T call Wendy Morrow
(Public Affairs). Just after moving into
her new home, the telephone company
assigned her a new number which
turned out to be the Hilton Hotel’s
number. She spent the first day in her
new house trying to explain to irate
callers why she wouldn’t take their
reservations. Like the commercial says,
“Next time call the Holiday Inn.”
 
STANDS FOR
ASSESSMENT
CW,
The Assessment Services Unit at Kent
Campus provides testing and support to
administration, students, faculty, staff
and the community. During 1987—88
more than 22,000 students and/or com-
munity members were tested. These
tests included CLEP, PEP, MAPS,
CLAST, ACT, GED, HSCBE, SSAT and
other specialized tests, e.g. insurance and
nursing exams. Offering such an array of
tests creates a monumental task of
recordkeeping.
In order to provide an efficient and
up-to—date system of student assessment,
it has become increasingly necessary to
provide increased computerization and
analysis of testing. Computerized Adap-
tive Testing is being piloted this spring
