 
 
second annual Florida Conference on
Communication for Community Col-
leges, held recently at the Omni
Jacksonville Hotel. The conference,
sponsored by FCCJ’s communication
instructional area, centered around
mutual concerns of communication
educators and attempted to discover
methods to bring about change in these
areas.
“It was a very upbeat conference,’ ’
said Dr. Jack E. Surrency, assistant dean
of communication at FCC]. “It was a
gathering of a group of people who are
really dedicated to making sure
improvements are made in communica—
tion programs, making things better for
teacher and student.” Surrency was
especially pleased with the increase in
participants this year. Eighteen comv
munity colleges out of 28 in the state
system sent representatives, a 20 percent
increase over last year. Some schools
sent their entire communication depart-
ments, said Surrency.
“Educators Moving Toward Action:
Effecting Change Within a School, a
Community and the State,” was the
conference theme. On Friday professors
from eight community colleges
throughout the state provided leader-
ship in discussing issues related to
communication. Some topics discussed
were testing, reading and writing skills,
teacher work loads and student reten—
tion. On Saturday, the questions
generated from Friday’s meetings were
presented to a group of panelists for
response. The panel included represen-
tative lawmakers, lobbyists and
spokespersons from a variety of profes-
sional communication organizations.
“This year’s conference was better
than our first one because it was not
just discussion of problems,” says Betsy
Griffey, professor, communication. “We
discovered ways to enact change
through professionals in communica—
tion, coalitions and our politicians.”
Griffey said she can see that real
changes will be the result of this
conference.
Holiday happiness
The holiday season is fast approaching
and our thoughts will soon be of
turkey, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie,
egg nog, mistletoe, tinsel and garland,
bells, Santa Claus, gifts and all the
other things that represent this happy
time of the year! The holiday season
has always been a time of celebration,
good times and lots of cheer here in
the United States. People travel from
near and far to join with their families
for this time of the year that centers
around tradition. So much tradition
that for some of us, spending the holi—
day season differently may seem strange.
Imagine if you were one of the
foreign students at FCC] who found
themselves living in the United States,
far from home and perhaps family as
well. Whose customs would be strange,
ours or theirs? We’d like to share some
of these customs with you and hope
they will help you better understand
that the world is indeed a very small
place after all!
Belci Gonzalez is from Guatemala,
which is in Central America. Their
holiday season begins in early
November with “Dia de los Santos,” the
holiday of the saints. Nov. 1 is a day for
remembering those “saints” who have
passed on. People in this country go to
visit the cemeteries and decorate the
tombs of their loved ones. Belici says
some people even bring candy and fruit
to the cemeteries. “They think the dead
will arise and eat,” she laughed.
Nydia Median of Honduras, says
Christmas in her country is pretty
much the same as here. However, while
we are all snug in our beds waiting for
the arrival of Saint Nick, the people of

Award—winning novelist and Jacksonville resident Elaine Konigsburg
focused on how com—
municators should stop and take time to “smell the roses” during her
keynote address to
attendees of the Communication Conference.
Professor of Communication Sue Pine
agreed, “We provided a format for
leaders in communication to get
together and form a coalition,” she said.
“This can lead to important successes
for communication programs in the
state.” Pine also stated that changes will
not occur overnight, so being patient is
the key. “Some of the solutions we
worked out may not take place for
three or four years, but at least we can
say we took part in getting things
started.”
Another highlight of the conference
was the Open Mike session held Satur—
day morning. This was an informal
session where participants shared
teaching methods they have found
effective. The keynote address for the
conference was given by award winning
novelist and Jacksonville resident Elaine
Konigsburg, who was described as “a
quiet spot in an energetic day.” Her
speech entitled “Between the Big Bang
and the Dial Tone” focused on how
communicators should stop and take
the time to “smell the roses.” Closing
around the globe
Honduras are out celebrating. Festivities
begin on Christmas Eve, with midnight
as the highlight of the evening. At this
time the entire family sits down to en—
joy a feast together. Nydia says Santa
Claus is big in Honduras. “Santa Claus
is the Christmas. If you don’t believe in
him, there is no Christmas,” she says.
Navidad (Christmas) is celebrated the
same in Nicaragua, says Luz Haydee
Fiel. “At midnight on Dec. 24 the
whole family goes to church together to
pray,” she says. “After that we come
back home, and the children find the
gifts under their beds. After opening
them all, we sit down to a big meal.”
Luz says this holiday is special because,
“All the family is together and celebratr
ing.”
The traditional turkey, ham and
cranberry sauce we eat on Christmas is
replaced with junk food in Dominica,
which is in the eastern Carribean. “It’s
a holiday,” says Dorian St. Ville. “You
don’t cook on a holiday! We enjoy cakes
and other sweets!” But this is not so for
the people in the Dominican Republic.
Dulcigelis Peguero, says an entire day is
spent preparing for the big family feast.
“We have turkey, roast pig, chicken,
tossed salad, breads, spaghetti and also
wine, she said. “Well, only the men
have wine,” she continued, “even my
little brother has a taste.” It is tradi-
tional in her country for each family to
prepare a plate from their table and
exchange it with their neighbors.
Adrian Vergara of Mexico says his
family also prepares a big meal.
However, the menu always includes dif—
ferent kinds of tamales, very hot
tamales!
remarks were given by The Honorable
Ralph Turlington, former Florida Com-
missioner of Educaion. Surrency said
Turlington was impressed with the con’
ference. He complimented organizers
and participants for taking the initiative
to help bring- about changes in the
communication area.
Surrency said he heard nothing but
positive comments from others who
were in attendance. He attributed the
conference’s success to the hard work of
the members of the Task Force who
organized the event. Luther Christofoli,
Betsy Griffey, Susan Hill, Sue Pine,
Elizabeth Reed, Edna Saffy, Mary
Louise Shannon, Jean Shepard, Brenda
Simmons and Nancy Smith all
volunteered their time and effort
making preparations for the conference.
“They even had meetings during the
summer,” Surrency said. “Everything
ran smoothly thanks to them.” He also
extends a special thanks to his secretary,
Edith Cooper, for all her dedication and
hard work in preparing for the
conference.
While Christmas is very big in the
U.S., New Year’s Day is Japan’s biggest
holiday. Kayuki Okuma says the govern-
ment gives three days off to public ser-
vants. “During this time people go and
visit their relatives and friends,” says
Kayuki. “Mothers fix special meals to
receive visitors with and the visitors
always bring gifts with greetings.” Some
people dress in Kimono cloth on that
day and at midnight they go to a Shin—
to shrine and pray for happiness for the
next year. “Children like this day
because they get pocket money,” he
says.
In the Dominican Republic, instead
of waiting for the ball to fall in Times
Square, they listen for 12 bells to signal
the beginning of the new year. “There
are bells and also a loud electronic
buzzer that everyone can hear,” says
Martina Fermin. “It’s a very happy
event. A time to greet everyone with
good wishes.”
New Year’s Day signals the end of the
holiday season here, but in most Latin
American countries Jan. 6 is a major
day of celebration too. Carmen Nunez
of Costa Rica says “Three Kings Day”
is the time to exchange gifts. “This day
represents when the kings brought gifts
to the baby Jesus. We have a prayer
around the ‘el portal’ (manger), open
our presents and feast together again,”
she says.
So as you can see, our holiday
customs may vary, but the feelings
shared are still the same. Like Sonia
Mejia of Guatemala says, “I enjoy this
special time of the year because
everyone is together in fellowship and
love.”
