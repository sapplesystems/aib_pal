 
Equal opportunities for all
Florida Community College is making
progress in its efforts to have full—time
staff members mirror its service area
population.
This information comes from the
198889 Status Report from the Equal
Access/Equal Opportunity Office. The
EA/EO office is responsible for directing
and coordinating the personnel activ—
ities necessary to achieve equity for all
protected classes within the College.
It is the College’s desire to have its
full—time staff be representative of the
population of its service area, which
includes Duval and Nassau counties.
Based on the April 1, 1987 population
estimates by the Bureau of Economic
and Business Research at the University
of Florida, FCCJ’s service area is 52.5%
female, 22.0% black and 3.0% other
minorities. Institutional employment
figures for 1988—89 show that three staff
divisions met or exceeded the service
area percentages: 4.1% of the faculty in—
cludes other minorities, professional
category is staffed by 67.7% female and
22.3% blacks, and career employees
with 64.0% female and 32.0% black
staff.
“Overall the College is making pro—
gress, however some departments still
don’t meet the goal,” says Rufus Jeffer—
son, director of EA/EO and the Col—
lege’s equity ofﬁcer. “There’s still work
to be done, especially in hiring disabled
persons.”
Jefferson, who has been director of
EA/EO since 1985, says the College’s
Affirmative Action Plan has been
instrumental in increasing equity in
staffing. FCC] has operated under a
voluntary affirmative action plan since
June, 1987. “Our affirmative action

Student success is the focal point of all
efforts at FCC], and after only one year
in operation the Student Success Center
is helping meet this priority.
The Student Success Center is the
central location of specialized programs
in various vocational training areas,
employability skills, job placement and
referral services. Students that have a
need for these special services come
here for help.
“Before our department was scattered
all over at different locations,” says Jeff
Oliver, director of development and
operations for performance contracting
at FCC]. “The center clarifies where we
are and who we are. It makes us iden—
tifiable to the students and staff as
well.”
Programs offered at the center in—
clude: JTPA Clerical Word Processing
Training (long—term unemployed),
Challenge (displaced homemakers), Jobs
for the Future (high school dropouts),

plan is an effective strategy designed to
direct attention to the need to hire
minorities, females and disabled persons
in all staff positions,” says Jefferson.
“The Supreme Court has ruled against
affirmative action plans based on quotas
or targeted positions, but our plan is
strictly voluntary. We simply place em—
phasis on the need to hire staff that
mirror our community.”
The afﬁrmative action plan is carried
out through different avenues, one of
which is specialized minority recruit—
ment for faculty and administrative/pro—
fessional positions. Bill Trawick,
employment officer, takes an active role
along with Jefferson in minority
recruitment. “We’ve been very suc—
cessful the last 18 months in our
minority recruitment,” says Trawick.
“We’ve attracted a number of faculty
members.” The status report attributes
the institution’s recruitment efforts to
the hiring of six black faculty, three
males and three females, in 1988—89.
Trawick says the College has directed
concerted efforts and resources to at—
tracting qualified applicants. Once a
year Trawick and Jefferson visit
predominately black colleges and
universities in search of potential canv
didates for employment. In October,
1988, a three-day onlsite recruitment,
spearheaded by Associate Vice—
Presidents Jon Cosby and Dennis
Gallon, was held in the Dallas/Ft.
Worth area. Trawick says this method
was very successful and is being looked
at for future use. Advertisements for
positions targeted toward minorities are
also placed in the Affirmative Action

Return to Learn (senior citizens), and
Success Training and Referral System
(STARS). On—site services from the
Private Industry Council of Jackson—
ville, Vocational Rehabilitation, and
HRSvProject Independence are also
available. At the center students are
directed to the proper offices where
they can get the assistance they need or
are referred to other agencies if they
cannot be helped here.
“\Ne are very pleased with the pro-
gress the center has made over this past
year. We’ve seen a 50 percent increase
in program participation,” says Oliver.
“Hundreds of students are being helped
and we are also being recognized by the
community. We receive many referrals
from community agencies.”
Since they are now centrally located,
the department plans numerous actin
ities for the students. “I just authorized
a pizza party for the high school
dropouts in our programs,” says Oliver.
&#39; “This is a motivational type activity to
 
 
 
 
 
encourage them to keep working. We
don’t give the students anything here,
we just challenge them properly. That’s
the key.”
Oliver also commends his staff for
their efforts in working with the stu-
dents. “All our staff loves these
students. You have to want to love the
kids who come through here, because
most of them are problem kids and
need extra care.”
Future plans are now being finalized
for a new computer complex in the
Success Center. It is being co-funded by
JTPA and the College, says Oliver. The
computers will be used during instruc-
tional teaching and as a tutorial tool.
Oliver says the complex is being built to
increase the number of students who
use the center’s services and offer them
better service.
“The center fits right in with what
the College stands for,” says Oliver, “it
promotes student success!”
