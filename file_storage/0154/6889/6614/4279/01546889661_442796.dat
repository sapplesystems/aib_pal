As we celebrate the College’s Silver
Jubilee, I have had the happy task of
tracking some of our alumni to see what
path they had taken over the last 25 years.
With more than 628,000 students passing
through our portals since opening day, there
are many success stories and I thought I’d
share a few of them with you.
Annie Harvey, elementary
school teacher
. Annie Harvey fulfilled a childhood
dream by attending what was then F]C.
The amazing part of her story is that she was
in her 405 had 10 of her 12 children still at
home and her husband&#39;s health was deteriOv
rating when she began her road to success.
Annie completed her studies, transferred to
UNF and was awarded the degree she had
hoped for since childhood. Now you can
find her passing her knowledge on to others
as a teacher at the Joseph Finnegan Elemenr
tary School in Atlantic Beach.

McMillan graduated from the College and
was the recipient of the Leroy Collins

Education program, which received the
largest Department of Labor grant given to
any college, university or community college

oversees an organization that provides
consumers with disabilities the tools to
enhance their lives and to advocate for
themselves. They couldn’t ask for a better
role model.

her public service “career” lobbying for safer
playgrounds. As her community involvement
grew, she entered the (then) F]C at 27,

Jim Stanford, auto body repair
]im Stanford, who received a technical
&#39;7
certificate from auto body repair, is really
bowling them over. He invented a mini— FLORIDA
bowlvshuffleboard game that has been COMMUNITY
adapted for the visuallyvimpaired and for COLLEGE
others with disabilities but can also be
played by those without disabilities, giving
everyone the same advantage. The game is
being manufactured now in the United
States, and ]im is looking toward an
international patent next. He said he has
always “mainstreamed,” despite the fact
that he is legally blind, and bowling was
one of the games that he participated in

Corrections Department and a true
spokesman for FCC].
I would be negligent if I didn’t mention
all of the members of the present FCC]
family, both faculty and staff, who in my
eyes are outstanding graduates. I wish we
had space to name each and every one of
you. You hold a very special place in the
history of the College, and we’re so glad

teleconference __ V
 
 
The College reviews all instructional
programs, services and operations on a
continuing cycle in order to identify ways
to improve. Resulting plans from the last
two reviews are listed below.
Interior Design
Joyce Butts, professor
Jenny Ohayon, professor
The Interior Design program is currently
offered only on Kent Campus due to
physical and room design requirements of
many of the courses. It is anticipated that
the program will also be offered at South
Campus when the new Performing Arts
Center is completed. The program
currently has an active advisory board
which has been very successful in obtaining
needed equipment donations. As the
program becomes more high—tech, addi
tional computers and graphics software will
be required. During 1990—1991, FCC]
enrolled 106 degreevseeking students in
Interior Design.
 
ACCREDITATION
Insurance Management
Jon Lyons, professor
In combination, the credit and none
credit programs had more than 1,500
enrollments during 1990—1991 and will
probably exceed those enrollments this
year. While enrollment in these courses
has increased, fewer students are completv
ing the associate in science degree program.
FCC] Insurance department plans to
continue expanding and updating course
offering to meet the needs of the insurance
profession.
