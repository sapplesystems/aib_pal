Artist Series sets sparkling season
By Ann Freeman
From the fairytale enchantment of
“Into the Woods” to the sparkling spin
of Dorothy Hamill’s skates in “Broad—
way on Ice,” the Artist Series’ 24th
season will keep Jacksonville audiences
glued to their seats from early October
through May 1990.
Artist Series Director Milton A.
Russos and his staff were busy long
before the first show of the season
opened, helping previous subscribers
renew their seats and new subscribers
secure theirs, answering questions about
upcoming shows, and filling ticket
orders by phone. Russos has continued
to expand the series year after year,
keeping the Artist Series Jacksonville’s
leading presenter of top—quality BrOad—
way and international entertainment.
This year the Artist Series schedule
consists of five Broadway musicals at
the Civic Auditorium, comprising the
Broadway season; five theatrical perfor-
mances at the Florida Theatre, compris-
ing the American Theatre season; the
International season, which has expand—
ed from three performances to four;
and the return of three Special Events.
The Broadway lineup includes the
Tony Award-winning family musical“Int
to the Woods” (Dec. 8, 9 Sr 10), the

hilarious “Nunsense” starring Dody
Goodman (Feb. 10 Si. 11), the timeless
classic “West Side Story” (Feb. 16, 17 &amp;
18), the world-class “Broadway on Ice”
starring Dorothy Hamill (March 30 Sr
31, April 1), and the Lincoln Center
revival of Cole Porter’s “Anything
Goes” with Mitzi Gaynor (May 9, 10,
11 &amp; 12).
The Pulitzer Prize-winning “Driving
Miss Daisy” (Jan. 13), starring
Rosemary Prinz and “Love Boat’s” Ted
Lange, headlines the American Theatre
season, which also includes the
delightful new Broadway version of
“The Pirates of Penzance” (Nov. 18),
Noel Coward’s “Blithe Spirit” (Jan. 24),
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”
(March 14), and the show-stopping
Preservation Hall Jazz Band (Jan. 26),
straight from New Orleans.
The first International season show of
the year is the exciting “Ballet
Hispanico ” (Oct. 4), followed this
month with “Her Majesty’s Black
Watch ” (Oct. 10), the most recorded
British Army regimental band. Two
operas, Bizet’s “Carmen” (Nov. 13),
presented in English by the San Fran—
ciSco Opera Center, and Puccini’s “La
Boheme” (March 23), performed in
Italian with English supertitles by the
New York City Opera National Com—
pany, complete this year’s International
offerings.
Three of Jacksonville’s favorites will
return to the Civic Auditorium stage
this season — “The Magic of David
Copperfield” (Jan. 19 Sr 20), “CATS”
(Feb. 2, 3 8L 4), and the revolutionary
“Les Miserables” (March 6 - 11) as
Special Events. Season subscribers may
purchase tickets to the special events
when they buy a subscription, before
these events go on individual sale to the
general public.
David Copperfield, in town for the
sixth consecutive year, will give four
performances over two days. The
February performances of “CATS,” here
for the fourth year, may be the last
chance to see this wonderful musical in
Jacksonville. And back for a full week,
by popular demand, the fabulous and
emotional “Les Miserables” will be here
in March.
New game plan for United Way
Is your son, relative or neighbor a boy
scout? Maybe your daughter belongs to
the girl scouts. Perhaps your family uses
the services of the YMCA.
These organizations are just a few of
the 55 member agencies supporting
nearly 100 programs in northeast
Florida that benefit from United Way.
The 1989 United Way of Northeast
Florida campaign, which kicked off
Sept. I, officially comes to a close Oct.
31. The northeast Florida goal is a 15
percent increase above last year’s
amount of $11.2 million.
FCCJ continues to be an avid sup—
porter of the cause and has set a goal of
raising $48,000, which is 15 percent
more than last year’s contribution of
$41,000. The College is asking all
employees to consider investing 1 per—
cent of their income in United Way.
“Various campuses and the College
Administration Building are developing
strategies for campaign rallies centered
around a football theme,” said Jack
Spears, collegewide chairman of the
1989 campaign. “The emphasis at our
College will be on continuing the high
percentage of participation, but, in ad
dition, will be directed toward each
giver giving a larger amount.”
Employees and students will again be
competing for awards. Last year, the
College introduced a new aspect of the
campaign by holding events and activi
ties to involve employees on each cam-
pus. From a fall carnival at Downtown
Campus and an Olympic-style torch
run at Kent, to a canoe race at North
Campus and a hot air balloon ride as a
prize at South, employees had a lot of
fun in the process of bringing in
money.
Students were involved in their own
form of fund raising. United Way
created a citywide campaign among all
college students and treated FCCJ’s
campuses as four separate colleges.
President Charles Spence recognized the
Downtown Campus students, who rais—
ed more money on behalf of United
Way than any other educational institu—
tion in the city participating in the stu—
dent campaign. They brought in $1,033
through a variety of projects, including
“jail and bail,” in which the students
created the idea of Spence raising his
own bail among employees.
For information about this year’s
campaign, contact your campus
coordinator.
 
The Artist Series continues to grow,
not only in the number of perfor—
mances offered each year, but also in
opportunities for community involve—
ment. Last month the Artist Series
hosted its first volunteer orientation
reception. With more than 40 volun-
teers assigned to various tasks, this
group of Artist Series ambassadors will
assist in the growth and development of
the program.
As always, FCCJ students and employ—
ees will receive special discounts on
most SeaSOn subscriptiOns and indivi—
dual, tickets (some restrictions apply).
Full&#39;time employees may purchase
tickets through payroll deduction plans
(contact your campus Student Activities
Office for more details).
For more information on any Artist
Series event or to purchase tickets, call
the Box Office at 632-3373 or stop by
the office located on the first ﬂoor of
the College Administration Building
between 10 a.m. and 4 pm. Students
and employees on various campuses
may also get information or place
orders at campus Student Activities
offices.
Ann Freeman is group sales and volunteer
coordinator for the Artist Series.

Retirees honored for years of service
Jeanne Jones bid a fond farewell after 17 years of service to FCCJ during
the College’s annual Retiree Banquet Aug. 17. Jeanne worked most recently
as administrative assistant to the president and, during her tenure, has
worked with 27 of the College’s 31 board members. President Charles
Spence (center) and board member Don Zell joined in the tribute to six
retirees at Harbormasters restaurant. In all, 14 retirees will each receive
a
resolution from the Board of Trustees honoring their service to the
College.
