Teaching and Learning conference goes high—tech
The arrival of FCCJ’s 25th Anniversary
celebration is a highly anticipated event.
This year’s celebration, however, will be
particularly memorable since it coincides
with the Third National Conference on
College Teaching and Learning.
According to Bill Martin, associate vice
president of instructional planning and
development, the idea for a national confer’
ence evolved out of FCCJ’s Center for the
Advancement of Teaching and Learning.
“We wanted to establish a means for
faculty members from across the country to
share ideas on teaching strategies and
instructional innovations,” said Martin, who
also serves as mentor to the Center. The
resulting National Conference on Teaching
and Learning is an educational event
planned by faculty for faculty.

Last year’s conference brought hundreds
of faculty members from community
colleges and universities from around the
country, but this year’s event promises to be
even bigger, with attendees from England,
Canada, Australia and Saudi Arabia, and
the addition of the technology track.
In addition to presentations by experts
in the field of educational technology, the
conference boasts a software fair, providing
handSvon experience with a variety of
multimedia programs, a virtual reality
demonstration, and a visit to the recently
completed electronic classroom on North
Campus, Martin said.
The Third National Conference on
College Teaching and Learning will take
place at the Omni Jacksonville Hotel,
Thurs, April 9 through Sat., April 11.
