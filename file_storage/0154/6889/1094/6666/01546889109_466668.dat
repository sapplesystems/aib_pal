to understand what’s going on in
Jacksonville,” Miner said.
“There’s a huge demand for this kind
of information in this format. This
series will help participants understand
the personality and culture of the city,”
Miner said.
The goal of the series, Clower said, is
to encourage participation in communi—
ty affairs. “With a historical perspective
on issues and problems, people are in a
better position to explore alternatives
and possible solutions.”
The series is just one of the many
examples of a successful joint venture
between the College and the communi—
ty, said Juliette Woodruff, special
projects manager for Open Campus and
immediate past president of JCCI.
“FCCJ has provided the expertise in
terms of producing the series, and JCCI
will provide the speakers and facility,”
Woodruff said.
The four—part series explores history,
education, consolidated government and
today’s government.
“From Cowford to Consolidation” is
a historical look at Jacksonville from
settlement by the Indians through cur—
rent times.
“Schools: Making the Grade” is a
review of the ups and downs and ups
of public education from the city’s first
schools to the present.
“Consolidation: Blueprint for
Improvement” is an overview of the
process that led to a consolidated city
government for Jacksonville.
“The Unfinished Agenda” is an
examination of the structure of local
government and how the spirit and
power of Jacksonville’s people cause
positive change. This segment will
document the process behind some of
the city’s success stories, such as the
abolishment of tolls.
“We want to leave the video open—
ended, so it can be a basis for discus—
sions for a number of years to come,”
said Clower.
Clower has been involved with the
project since January 1988. Having
moved to Jacksonville just four years
ago, she perhaps knows more about the
city than most longtime residents.
Several bits of trivia in particular
piqued Clower’s interest:
Cl The St. Johns River was once called
the River May by an explorer who
crossed the then—treacherous channel on
the first day of May in the 15005.
Mayport, home today to a significant
Naval station, gets its name from its
location on the river.
D Jacksonville used to be the world’s
winter film capital, and Oliver Hardy
got his start here.
[:1 “Strangers in the Night,” a song
immortalized by Frank Sinatra, was
written by Jacksonville citizen Charlie
Singleton.
D In the late 18008—early 19005,
Jacksonville had the most outstanding
school system in the state. In 1964, all
high schools were disaccredited. In the
next decade, all schools were accredited,
making Duval County one of the
largest accredited school districts in the
nation.
The video that deals with consolida—
tion had a sneak preview at the JCCI
annual meeting in September, when the
problem—solving organization observed
the 20th anniversary of the city’s con—
solidated government.
 
This segment will document
the process behind some of
the city’s success stories,
such as the abolishment of
tolls.
 
The video was also presented at the
city’s Sept. 29 celebration of the 20th
anniversary of consolidation (Oct. 1,
1968).
In working on the video series,
Clower was given access to a wealth of
materials, such as vintage postcards,
photos, clippings and a treasure trove of
remembrances, from local television sta—
tions and newspapers, historians and
residents from all walks of life.

tion series is offered through FCCJ’s
Lifelong Learning department.
 
Minority Business
Selena Mendez now understands the
significance of “being your own boss.”
The former FCC] student is a business
major at Florida ASLM University and
has decided to become an entrepreneur
after participating in FCCJ’s Minority
Business Enterprise Project.
Selena is one of 150 minority youth
predominantly from the northwest
quadrant of Jacksonville who are being
encouraged to pursue educational
excellence by staying in school and to
use their own talents to become
entrepreneurs.
The project is coordinated through a
consortium that includes Florida Com—
munity College at Jacksonville, the
Jacksonville Urban League, Edward
Waters College and the Minority
Business Development Center. This is
FCCJ’s second year of participation in
the project.
“We try to reach minority students 16
to 21 years old to inform them about
the possibilities and rewards of entering
private enterprise or a busineSS career.
The vast majority of minority students
haven’t had that much experience in
business except by being a customer,”
said Rufus Jefferson, project
administrator and FCCJ’s director of
equal access/equal opportunity.
The project is funded by a $20,625
grant from the American Association of
Community and Junior Colleges. Seven
other community college consortia were
selected for funding “from a very
competitive group of MBEP proposals,’ ’
according to James F. Gollattscheck,
executive vice president of AACJC.
“We have a very successful program.
Ours is being held out as a model in
the Southeast,” Jefferson said.
This is the second year FCC] has
received funding for the project. Both
the funding and the number of par—
ticipating students and business owners
have doubled from last year’s project.
Students from Jackson, Paxon, Raines
and Ribault high schools, as well as col—
lege students under 21, are receiving
entrepreneurial training in “The Fun—
damentals of Business Start—Up.” The
business management skills sessions
began in October and will run through
December.
Enterprise a “boss”
The 150 students were chosen from a
group of 2,000 local students who par—
ticipated in youth awareness activities to
receive information and motivation
about available business careers.
The project also provides free
business management training for 150
minority business owners and managers
to upgrade their working skills.
“After the sessions, we match a stu—
dent with an entrepreneur for whatever
amount of time that entrepreneur is
willing to give and allow that student
to be ‘shadowed’ with the entrepre—
neur,” said Kathy Brown, project
coordinator.
“Shadowing” refers to a student
observing a mentor and becoming
involved in the day—to—day business
operations as the owner allows.
In addition to Selena, two high
school students and another college stu—
dent attended the National Conference
of the Minority Business Development
Agency in San Diego, Calif., in which
entrepreneurs from throughout the
project
 
nation shared their experiences. Some
of the entrepreneurs were graduates of
the South Bronx Enterprise Project and
are&#39;teenagers who have been in busi—
ness from nine months to two years
and are still in high school. Among
those sharing their experiences were a
clothing designer, a commercial artist
and a consultant for prospective
entrepreneurs.
The 150 students involved in the pro—
ject are also receiving training on how
to write, market and budget a business
plan. One of the project’s activities
includes an essay contest on “Writing a
Business Plan.” A panel of judges will
select the five best essays, and awards in
the form of US Savings Bonds will be
made: $300 for first place; $200 for
second place; $100 for third place; $75
for fourth place; and $50 for fifth
place. The awards program will be Jan. 5.
