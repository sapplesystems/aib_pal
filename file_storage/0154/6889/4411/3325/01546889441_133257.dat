Hope all of you had a joyous holiday season
with your loved ones and were able to share
some of your good fortune with the less
fortunate around us. Sometimes the best
gift is to give rather than receive.
Mending those fenced in
If you ever want to give someone a well—
deserved pat on the back, just visit the
Montgomery Correctional Institute where
FCCJ instructors, under the direction of
Charles Flowers (Adult Studies), are
reaching out to help prisoners. Mary
Arnett, Kathleen Bergeron, Eugene
Center, Robert Flowers, Henry Floyd and
Scott Mac Greggor (Adult Studies) are
helping to rehabilitate prisoners through
literacy training. From what I saw, these
are exceptionally dedicated people who
really want to make a difference. Lack of
literacy skills seems to be at the base of so
many of the world&#39;s social ills. Just seeing
what these people are accomplishing made
me want to give them all a standing
ovation.
Who’ll take the North Campus
challenge?
Nancy McDuffie (Provost’s Office)
dropped me a line to say she, Helen Lubas
and Pat Stores (Nursing), Jim Woods
(Allied Health) and Wayne Baker
(Librarian), would like to offer up a
challenge to other tennis players around
the College. One thing about playing with
the folks from North Campus..if anything
goes wrong, you get great medical attention.
Give Nancy a buzz at 766/6552, but
beware...she may be small, but she’s mighty.
I know because she beat the heck out of me
while pounding the fuzz.
Let the chips fall where they may
As usual, South Campus is knee deep in
good ideas. They raised funds for the
United Way by holding a Bovine Biscuit
Bonanza. This SGA~sponsored activity,
spearheaded by Billy Morse (SGA vice
president), raised mooocho bucks.
According to Don Hughes (Student
Activities), a field was marked off and deeds
were sold to parcels of land for $3. You
guessed it. If a cow dropped a chip in your
parcel, you won either $200, $75 or $50.
Better steer clear of South Campus.
Yellow ribbon brigade
Mary Wilson (Student Activities) is a
supreme person. (Hope you’ll pardon that
awful pun.) She and her daughter Regina, a
student at the North Campus, put together
a drive they call “Together We Stand” to
bring good tidings and cheer to those
defending our country in the Persian Gulf.
The purpose was for everyone to donate
much needed articles for servicemen and
women. Mary provided white boxes with
little yellow ribbons that said “I donated” at
various collection points around the
campus. Regina created all the posters for
the collection and was driving force in
making this good deed a success. The dead,
line for collection has been extended to
January 11 for an unexpected after—holiday
surprise for the troops. Anyone is welcome
to donate newspapers, paperback books,
toiletry items, black markers and
moisturizing lotions, but religious literature,
pork products, alcohol and tobacco are not
acceptable. And, of course, no “pinaups.”
If everyone donated one small item, just
think of the good we could do. For more
information, call Mary Wilson at 766’6786.
Ho ho ho down
Those of you who know Holly Koehler
Croup (Artist Series) would surely say only
Holly could pull off a wedding like hers.
Imagine the swank Omni Hotel as the scene
of a good old Southern wedding, complete
with home cooked tater salad, baked beans,
fried chicken, ham and sweet tater pie. Bet
that menu threw the catering department
into a tizzie. Holly and Bill (aka. “The
Colonel”) invited everyone over for moon
pies and diet cola after the honeymoon, sure
nuff! That’s what happens when a yankee
like Bill crosses the Mason Dixon line and
falls for a southern belle.
The purrfect pet
Mike Busby (Learning Lab) raises
Siamese and breed cats for top—show quality.
He has kittens as pets, breeders and top—
show. He entered four kittens in a
Melbourne cat show and one of them,
Krentyl’s Batman, finaled in two judging
rings, earning two 10th Best Kitten rosettes.
His winnings will be printed in the Cat
Fancy Association Almanac which is
published monthly and distributed
worldwide. Just another one of FCCJ‘s
many animal lovers.
And that’s the purrfect way to end this
month’s column.
