They may not
have won him a
Lotto jackpot, but
Gary Elvik feels as
if he has his own
lucky numbers.
Two years ago,
Elvik was one of
only 150 enlisted
personnel chOSen
throughout the
country to participate in the United States
Navy’s Enlisted Education Advancement
Program. As part of the program, Elvik, 28,
was given 24 months as a fullatime student
to pursue his associate’s degree.
“I had to check in at NAS ]ax to let
them know I was still alive, but basically I
was on my own,” he said. “And for someone
like me who never had much academic
ambition, there was an awful lot of room to
mess up.”
Elvik didn&#39;t come close to “messing up,”
however. He completed his A.A. with a
3.88 GPA and recently ended his term as
president of the Upsilon Eta Chapter of Phi
Theta Kappa. “Pretty good for someone who
finished high school with a 2.0 GPA and in
the lower 50th percentile,” he laughed.
His success at FCC] brought him another
set of lucky numbers when he was one of only
14 sailors in the country selected to particir
pate in the Navy’s Enlisted Commissioning
Program. As part of the program, Elvik plans
to attend the University of Oklahoma,
working toward a bachelor’s degree in
mathematics. Upon graduation he will be
commissioned as an ensign in the Navy.
“Since enrolling at FCC], I have accom—

plished a lot. The education I have gained
will be beneficial to me, not only in my
naval career but in every area of my life,” he
said. “I&#39;ve seen what an education can do,
and I’m glad I got mine at FCC].”
Lawrence Mebane
Lawrence Mebane
was looking for a
change in his life.
He found it at FCC].
Mebane, 34,
worked at the US.
Postal Service as a
mail handler for
eight years when he
decided he wanted
to pursue a career
“where I used my brain instead of my back.”
Taking a cue from his wife, a nurse at St.
Vincent’s Medical Center, Mebane enrolled
in FCC]’s A.S. degree in nursing program in
1990. “I also chose the program for my love
of people,” he said.
Despite his affinity for helping others,
Mebane’s completion of the rigorous
nursing program was no easy task. “It was
hard work,” he said “But I had faith in
myself and in God, and if you have that, you
are unstoppable.”
Being unstoppable is something Mebane
knows all about. In addition to his full load
of classes and clinical hours, he worked full
time as a unit secretary at St. Vincent‘s,
ministered at a prison, coached a basketball
team and stayed involved with his church.
In his spare time, he wrote, produced and
directed a musical called “Reflections of
Dr. King.”
“I feel like FCC] has given me a road
map for success,” he told his fellow gradu«
ates. “Occasionally, I exited that road, but
there was always
someone there to
fix my flat tire or
refill my tank and
get me back on that
road to graduation.”
Mebane hopes to
find employment as
a psychiatric or
emergency room
nurse, eventually
enrolling at UNF to
earn his bachelor’s
degree in nursing.
His ultimate goal,
however, is to
become a motiva—
tional speaker.
 
    
 
Some students who become deeply
involved with
extracurricular
activities while in
college find that
their grades suffer.
For Annie Mont—
gomery, however,
experiences outside
the classroom have
not only improved
her academic
standing, they changed her life.
When Montgomery, 27, enrolled full
time at FCC] in 1991, she was already
volunteering at her church’s daycare center
and several local schools. As the founding
coordinator of the South Campus volunteer
center, she expanded her community
involvement. According to Montgomery,
her volunteer service “set the stage for
everything else.”
“[Volunteering] enhanced my education
by teaching me things I couldn’t learn in
textbooks. It gave me real life experience
that I can put on my resume,” she said.
“And it makes me feel good to know that I
am helping others.”
Volunteering also helped Montgomery to
realize her long—term goal — becoming an
administrator in the education field. “I have
so many ideas of how we can improve
education. I want to make changes and
make a difference,” she said.
To many, Montgomery has already begun
to make a difference in the ]acksonville
community. The Florida Office of Campus
Volunteers recently presented her with one
of three 1993 Excellence in Service Awards
given in the state.
“Success is not just about making money
or making a name for yourself. It’s about
making a difference in society,” she told her
fellow graduates. “So, to you I say go and
do something.”
Montgomery plans to pursue her
bachelor’s degree in education at UNF.
