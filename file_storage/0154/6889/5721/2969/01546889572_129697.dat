Community College
1991 Convocation celebrates the
past and prepares for the future
The traditional August convocation
ceremony will be given a. different twist this
year—in addition to celebrating the coming
year, FCC] will be Commemorating its past
as well.
“We are really excited about this year’s
convocation,” said Bill Martin, associate
vice president of instruction, planning and
development and chairman of the
convocation committee. “Whereas
convocation typically gives us the
opportunity to look forward and see where
we’re going, the anniversary will also give us
the opportunity to look back and see where
we’ve been—a chance to celebrate the past
and also prepare for the future.&quot;
As part of the anniversary celebration, a
collection of historical items, including
newspaper clippings, photographs and
publications from 25 years, will be
showcased. The College’s oral history book,
An Oral History of Florida Community College
at Jacksonville, 1963—1 991, will be distributed
and will also be available for sale for those
who didn’t order earlier. President Spence
will also address the College’s impact on the
community over the years in his annual
speech to employees. And carrying on the
years‘ofrservice tradition, 20 and 25 year
employees will be honored.
A new addition to the convocation
ceremony will be the presentation of awards
for outstanding faculty, Career Employees
Council excellence, Career Employees
Council Leadership and Trustees
Community Service. Previously held at
commencement, the awards presentation
was considered, by administrators, to be
more appropriate for convocation. “It makes
more sense to have it at convocation,”
Martin said. “Being recognized in front of
their peers, like this, will probably be a lot
more meaningful [to the recipients].”
Convocation will be held at South
Campus on Wed, August 21 at 8:00 am

FCCJ&#39;s silver anniversary shines
While a wedding anniversary gives a couple
the opportunity to celebrate a successful
marriage, FCC]’s 25th anniversary will
allow the College to commemorate a
prosperous union of its own.
With the community college concept
firmly ensconced within the minds of state
legislators and educators in the mid ’60s,
Florida ]unior College may have be destined
for success before its doors even opened.
But in reality, it was the junction of three
different groups—College employees,
students and residents that have made
Florida Community College at Jacksonville
the thriving institution that it is today.
This partnership between College and
community will be the focus of the FCCJ&#39;s
25th anniversary celebration.
“Of course, it’s important for an
institution to stop now and again and look
back at what it has achieved—and FCC]
really does have a lot to celebrate—but we
[the employees] aren’t the only ones who
have something to feel good about,” said
Kent Campus Provost Charles Dassance,
who co~chairs the 25th anniversary
celebration with Open Campus Provost
Carol Miner.
“The community and students also need
to be part of the anniversary. FCC] has
created an incredible amount of economic
development for‘this city, and our residents
need the opportunity to celebrate that,”
Dassance said. “F]C was the also the first

post-secondary opportunity for most of these
students in ]acksonville, which is something
that they should celebrate. This really is
their college.&quot;
Scheduled to kickoff at convocation and
run through 1992 commencement, the 25th
anniversary celebration has three goals,
according to Miner. “First, we want to
celebrate our accomplishments. Secondly,
we want to look toward the future. And, of
course, we want to have fun,” she said.
Though both Dassance and Miner
admitted to being thrilled about the
possibilities for this year—long celebration,
they have been careful in planning specific
events. “We’re real excited [about the
anniversary celebration], but our first
thought was ‘how can we do this without
turning people off?” Dassance said. “I
thought the wOrst thing we could do in a
situation like this would be to drive people
crazy with overdoing it. It shouldn’t be a
burden to anyone, but it should help give a
sense of pride to us as employees.”
Dassance and Miner found their solution
by setting up a College focus group. By
getting input from faculty, administrators,
professional and career employees, they
could best determine what employees
wanted out of the celebration. “There was
no big consensus on any one event.
Essentially what we got out of the meeting
was that there was nothing we could do
right and nothing we could do wrong,”
Dassance said.
