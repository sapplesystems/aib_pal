News
I had a heck of a good time this month
ﬂying around the campuses on my
vacuum cleaner (no old broomsticks for
this modern witch), sucking up the
news for Bobbi’s Beat. I really love
Halloween. It gives me the opportunity
to be a real witch. Wave next time I fly
by!
One busy lady
Counselor Hortense Gray, Kent, is
one busy lady. Not only is she heavily
involved in church work at St. Gabriel’s
Episcopal Church, but she was immers—
ed in preparing for the Slst anniversary
of Boylan Haven High School when I
had the delightful opportunity to talk
with her. Boylan Haven was originally
a private Methodist high school for
black girls that was phased out in 1956.
What a rich treasure of memories for
Hortense. She’s also chaplain of the
school’s national alumni association.
Bookworms
From the long list of great
titles...Ginger Plumer, senior clerk,
CAB, and Faye Janata, administrative
secretary in enrollment services, CAB,
are busy working on a potential
bestseller, “How to get rid of ex—
husbands and other common house—
hold pests.” Maybe they need to call
Orkin. For years I’ve been working on
“Oops, pardon my G string: Memoirs
of a girl bass player on the road.”
Maybe we need to take some lessons
from Joyce Hart, curriculum services of-
ficer, CAB, and distinguished published
author of “The Last Cracker.”
How does your garden grow?
Have you ever given any thought to
what it takes to keep the grounds
around CAB looking so good? It makes
me proud to think this is where most
of our visitors come. All the credit goes
to Dagmar Strickland, plant services
worker III, who has been the keeper of
the green for almost five years now. No
wonder she handles that equipment
with such ease. She was a mechanic in
the Army for two years. Next time you
see Dagmar, tell her how much you ap—
preciate the nice environment!
Well, it’s the bewitching hour.
Happy Halloween! See you as I ﬂy by.
On The Move

tinuing Education last month in

World University Games, held every
two years, are the recognized worldwide
olympics for college athletics. During
fall 1988, events in more than 20 sports
will be held in various countries
throughout the world.
Jim Woods, professor, and the

United Way campaign jumps high hurdles
In keeping with the 1988 Winter and
Summer Olympics, the College has
chosen the theme “FCCJ—United Way
Olympic Celebration” for this year’s
campaign.
“Sporting” events and activities on
each campus are planned for the Oct. 3
— 7 celebration, with awards being given
for creativity and participation in
several categories. Focusing on one week
of festivities is a new aspect of FCCJ’s
annual campaign efforts.
Another aspect of FCCJ’s campaign is
involving more career employee par-
ticipation. “We want to work as a team
on each campus, ” said Judy Robbins,
chairman of the Career Employees
Council. “The council will be working
closely with the campus committees to
encourage 100 percent participation
from career employees as a whole.”
Employees are encouraged to con—
tribute, to assist their provost and vice
presidents in campaigning on each came
pus, and to spread the word to other
employees that United Way offers a
multitude of services that could benefit
them now or in the future, Robbins said.
The College’s goal for this year is to
raise $31,196, 15 percent more than last
year. The goal for northeast Florida is
to raise $11.6 million, 12 percent more
than last year.
Many employees enrich the College
when they give to United Way. Several
UW member agencies have close ties
with FCC]. The Episcopal Child Day
Care Centers, Inc. operates the center at
Downtown Campus; the Learn to Read
program shares resources and a referral
system with FCCJ’s Adult Basic Educa-
tion program; and Goodwill Industries
shares a common referral system with
the College’s Disabled Student Services
Center.
Contributions to United Way support
55 health and human care agencies
throughout northeast Florida. “All of
our monies here at the College come
from the public, and now you and I
have the opportunity to return some of
these benefits we receive to the com—
munity,” said President Charles Spence.
Spence is on the United Way Board
of Directors and is the chairman of the
local United Way Loaned Executive pro—
gram and the education unit.
The citywide campaign kicked off
Sept. 1 and will run through early
November.
Convocation showcases student success
“Success...is truly a personal ex—
perience,” said a student featured in a
video presented during fall convocation
that carried the theme “We Measure
Success One Student at a Time.”
President Charles Spence presented
the staffrproduced video to a standing—
room-only audience at the Kent Cam—
pus auditorium to celebrate the begin—
ning of a new school year and welcome
faculty returning from summer break.
Spence’s closing remarks challenged
all employees to work toward student
success by beginning with themselves:
First, he said, “have a willingness to
change” by placing resources and
energies where they bring about the
most benefit and looking at how
technology can help teaching
methods...Second, “be creative, in—
novative and explore alternative ways to
achieve goals.” All students deserve
every day to be taught by inspired
teachers, and teachers deserve support
from management, he said...And third,
he said, “I challenge each of you to
make a contribution to student success
every day.”
During the program, Spence also
recognized FCCJ’s 20-year employees,
saying they “came with the bricks and
are now a part of the mortar.” Several
new employees, coming to the College
from as near as the University of North
Florida and as far as England, were also
recognized.
