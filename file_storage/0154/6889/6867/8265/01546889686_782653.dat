Commencement falling on the heels of
the College’s 25th anniversary celebration is
a great way to close out the school year. I
know after the unusually long, cold winter,
everyone is looking forward to a sunny
spring. I wonder if the lingering cold
weather had anything to do with the
“population explosion&quot; around the cam—
puses? Between the expected bundles of joy
and the proliferation of wedding bells, we
should have a “built—in” student population
by the year 2016.
Officer Friendly
Three cheers for Sgt. Tom Yorton
(security, Geis Marine) for providing a safe
environment not only for the staff but for
the elderly folks in the neighborhood. You
can drive by Geis any day of the week and
see people out walking, exercising them—
selves and their pets. One of the “regulars”
is a woman who walks her little dog Caesar,
under the watchful eye of Sgt. Yorton.
Every neighborhood should have its own
“officer friendly.”
A natural habitat
What would be more natural than Jesse
Crews (Building Construction Technology)
working with the good folks at “Habitat for
Humanity” to help provide decent housing
for&#39; people who are less fortunate. Working
on these construction projects should be
right up Jesse’s alley. Another fine example
of the College’s strong volunteer commit—
ment to the community.
Aye Aye, Captain!
That phrase generally conjures up a burly
looking guy with a bushy beard and a
weather—beaten face. Lydia Dye (enroll—
ment services, MCCS) sure proves you can’t
judge a book by its cover. She is now
Captain Lydia Dye, licensed to carry
passengers for hire and operate a ship up to
100 gross tons and 80 feet long on all U. S.
inland waters and up to 200 miles offshore
in international waters. Lydia’s interest in
boats was sparked when she joined the
Jacksonville Offshore Club, an organization
that maintains the 22 offshore buoys in
Jacksonville. As a member of its board of
directors, she worked with George Strate,
captain of Miss Mayport, who actually puts
the buoys out. After watching her work
aboard his ship as a volunteer, George
encouraged her to go for her master’s
license. All we can say is “full speed
ahead” to Lydia.
Don’t litter, spay/neuter
Richard Snipes (AV, North) and his
wife Anna are once again providing nursery
service to four healthy kittens born to a cat
abandoned at North Campus. Richard and
his wife have rendered this service many
times before and are to be applauded for
their care and concern for animals. They
have three females and one male, all in
need of good and loving homes. They have
all been tested and are negative for feline
leukemia. Richard is looking for loving
homes for his latest “kitty litter.” He’s
especially interested in people who will care
enough to have these little critters spayed or
neutered. If you have a warm spot in your
heart for a little fuzz ball, call Richard
at 766—6684.
Teed off
If anyone on Kent Campus tells you
Troy James (Consumer and Human
Services) and Dave Morrison (Assessment
Services) are teed off at each other, just
smile and say, “I think that’s teed off with
each other, not-at each other.” I’d say that’s
a big difference! Troy and Dave have been
meeting with Mr. Green on a regular basis,
including some days when they could have
used water wings instead of golf clubs. Troy
said even though his score is far from par,
he’s had a great time using the golf clubs his
wife gave him for Christmas. L
Another twinkling star
Elyse Brady (Open Campus) has had a
pretty exciting time of it lately. First, she
arrived home from vacation and was greeted
at the airport by her boyfriend turned fiancé
with roses and a diamond engagement ring.
As if that weren’t exciting enough, she’s
“back on the boards” again at Theatre
Jacksonville, playing the role of Sister Mary
Amnesia in Numense. What will she do for
an encore?
Heading upriver
If you heard George Bohler (social
science, North) was sent “up the river,”
you’re absolutely right. But in this case, it
was under positive circumstances, not
negative. George and friend Don Knight
placed first in the Fifth Annual River City
Canoe Race, sponsored by the Data Process—
ing Management Association . This is the
 
second win in a row (pardon the pun) for
George. The race began at Jacksonville
University’s dock and continued 2—1/2 miles
upriver to the finish line at Geis .
Best beneﬁt of all
If you ask Barbara Wheeler (FCCJ
Foundation) what she thinks is the best
benefit she received while working for the
College, she’ll tell you a heck of a story. In
her early years at the College, Barbara was
asked to handle the paperwork for the
United Way Campaign. While thumbing
through the material, the name Children’s
Home Society caught her eye and the fact
that they handled adoptions interested her.
After much soul searching, and several years
gone by, Barbara and her husband Gary,
decided to place their name on the list for a
baby. This month their precious Audrey
turned eight years old.
1 hope all of you have exciting plans for
summer vacations. Travel with care and
think about how you can really get to know
the people and culture of the places you
visit, whether you travel within our country
or out.
