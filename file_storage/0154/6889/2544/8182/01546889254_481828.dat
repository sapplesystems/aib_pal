Foundation builds a rock—solid base
A new endowment fund has been
established through the FCC]
Foundation.
The Trustee’s Award for Faculty Com-
munity Service is being created due to
the generosity of Nathan H. Wilson,
retiring board chairman. Wilson, who
served on FCCJ’s board of trustees for
five years, established the endowment
with a $4,500 contribution.
The fund will provide a cash award
for a selected faculty member who has
made an exceptional contribution in
working with a community agency.
“This does not require a person to be
president of a community organization,”
says Wilson, “but can reflect the deep
commitment and extensive service by
the nominee on behalf of a community
organization.”
Nominations for the award will be re-
quested after January. Then a commit-
tee representing the Foundation board
members and College trustees will make
the annual selection. Presentation of
the award is tenatively set to coincide
with close of the school year activities.
Questions regarding this award or
contributions to this endowment fund
should be directed to the FCC] Founda—
tion office at 632—3237.
Annual Fund update: employees “Sup-
port Excellence”
Employees at FCCJ have contributed
$32,750 to the College in Phase I of
the Foundation’s Annual Fund drive,
announces Executive Director Art
Ruppel.
“This wonderful staff response is
especially gratifying to me,” says Ruppel.
“It shows the community at large we
believe the Foundation is serving a good
purpose in assisting students and pro-
grams.”
The Foundation solicited funds inter—
nally throughout the month of
September with Phase II of the drive
now in progress. The Foundation will
be soliciting board members of the Col—
lege and Foundation, the Advisory
Council, and special friends in the com-
munity. The drive is a year—round
event, so contributions from staff will
still be accepted at this time.
Funds raised in the Annual Fund
Glasntos on the St. Johns
drive will support scholarships, com—
puter support and professional develop—
ment in the coming school year.

drive, call 632—3237.
Nov. / Dec. 1989
Ron Richards (right), director, Geis Marine Center, speaks with President
Charles Spence (center), and Soviet educators
Leonid Finker and Mizra Makhmoutov. They visited FCC] recently to meet with
faculty and program directors to exchange
ideas and discuss how a community college concept can be adapted in the
Soviet Union. FCC] is one of three community
colleges in the US. that will serve as models for the Soviet’s new
college system. The Soviet’s visit followed a trip by Dr.
Spence and two other community college presidents to the Soviet Union in
August.
Effectiveness indicators project success
Just as any other institution of higher
education, FCC] is concerned with how
well it is accomplishing its goals as a
community college. In January 1989
the Institutional Effectiveness Indicators
project was implemented as a measur—
ing tool.
“There are thousands of ways to
judge the effectiveness of an institution,
different people have different ideas,”
says President Charles Spence. “What
we’ve tried to do is develop specific
ways to communicate information both
internally and externally about how the
College is doing.”
FCC] is guided by a plan of action
organized into four strategic directions:
student sucesss, valued employees, in“
novation for excellence and quality
communication. From these four direc—
tions, 26 performance indicators have
been developed to designate where the
action is taking place. These indicators
were chosen through a survey and
elimination process of ideas from the
board of trustees, institution vice
presidents and outstanding faculty
award winners.
“When the final report is made, we
will definitely learn some things about
ourselves, and some things we may
dislike,” admits Spence. “However,
when we set a goal for improvement
and then see the improvements haven’t
occurred. we have to stop and ask why?”
Spence says this project will be effective
because it forces FCC] to ask the right
questions, which is the secret of success.
Since this is the first year implement—
ing the project, goals for each indicator
have yet to be set. Institutional Effec—
tiveness Task Forces are now at work
setting the direction for each of the 26
performance indicators.
“The project is the implementation of
setting the direction for these indicators,
and task forces will set these targets or
goals,” says Pamela Grey, director of In—
stitutional Planning and Instructional
Support. Each task force group consists
of a mixture of faculty and adminis-
trators. Each group has a leader and a
set of specific indicators to work with.
The groups will also review dates, deter—
mine support standards of effectiveness
and discuss college issues related to
each indicator. The targets, standards
and issues will then go through a pro—
cess of review and prioritization by dif-
ferent committees until a final report is
submitted by the president to the board
of trustees in February 1990.
Grey says one of the key outcomes of
the project is the involvement of the
faculty members and the opportunity
for them to network and be heard on
different levels. “It’s very refreshing to
see everyone getting excited about work—
ing on these committees,” she said.
Another major outcome of this pro-
ject, says Grey, is the College will be
able to see how well resources are being
used. Lynn Parker, Vice president, Plan—
ning, Marketing and Human Resources,
agrees, “This project is a very tangible
way of seeing what we do and offers
direct communication with the board
of trustees and the community. In a
nutshell it answers these three ques-
tions: What are we doing? How do we
know what we’re doing? And how well
are we doing it?”
Grey says the final report made to the
board of trustees will become a
historical document. “It will tell the
history of the College and the targets
will determine what lies beyond these
charts and tables. This document will
allow us to know how well we are do—
ing and also allow us to see our destina—
tion on the horizon.”
Presently, the indicators chosen are
set for four to five years, however the
College is ﬂexible and they are subject
to change, says Parker. “The world is
changing and we want to keep in tune
with what’s going on.”
“FCCJ is one of the few community
colleges in the US. to have a program
that measures its institutional effec-
tiveness,” says Parker proudly. “We
developed our own plan and after look-
ing at others I think we have a model
program. Because of this accomplishment
we are in the forefront, and happily so.”
