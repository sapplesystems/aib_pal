FCCJ Artist Series is on a roll
If you&#39;ve wondered whether the FCC]
Artist Series will ever fail to outdo its previous
season, keep wondering. The upcoming
season has enough star power and diversity to
whet the appetite of any arts enthusiast.
FCC] Artist Series breaks new ground this
season, yet reprises some of the best—loved
entertainment of all time. “Starlight Express,”
the Andrew Lloyd Weber roller skating
musical spectacular, is the crown jewel in the
1990—91 Broadway season. Scheduled for
February 2224, this Tony/winning musical is
said to be the biggest, most technically
sophisticated touring musical ever.
“It’s an absolute assault on the senses,” says
Artist Series Director Milt Russos. “Each of
the 37 actors portrays a train on roller skates,
and each has his own personality. Together,
they create a spectacular light and sound show
which captivates the audience. Everyone
walks out with a smile.”
 
“Starlight Express&quot; is one of many crowd—
pleasers on the Broadway Season bill. In
November, the legendary singer—dancer Juliet
Prowse stars in the much—loved
musical “Marne.” “A Chorus Line,” will stop
here in March after 15 years on Broadway; a
number of the members of the last Broadway
cast will be with the show.
Mary Martin brought “Peter Pan” to life
35 years ago, and now Olympic gymnast Cathy
Rigby stars as the boy who won’t grow old.
Critics say she gives an exciting and daring
performance as the ‘flying’ Peter Pan. “Peter
Pan” will play in mid—April after a special
Broadway run. Another timeless favorite,
Rogers and Hammerstein&#39;s “The Sound of
Music,” will play Jacksonville in January.
The American Theatre Season includes
Hal Holbrook’s “Mark Twain,” called the most
successful one—man production in the history of
American theater. Neil Simon’s latest
Broadway hit, “Rumors,” starring Peter
Marshall and Patty McCormack, plays during
the American Theatre Season, as does “Master
Harold...and the boys,” termed “the best play of
the season” by the New York Times. The
season is rounded out with the revival of “The
Pajama Game,” with its hit songs “Steam
Heat,” “Hey There” and “Hernando&#39;s
Hideaway,” and the always entertaining return
of “The Flying Karamazov Brothers.”
The Artist Series‘ lntemational Season
features some of the world’s foremost
performers, this year including some from the
Soviet bloc nations. “Lezginka,” the State
Dance Ensemble of Daghestan, USSR,
highlights the colorful folk dance and song of a
remote and exotic Soviet region. Costuming
for the group is enhanced by the work of world
famous goldsmiths and weavers.
“Ballet Folklorico de Mexico,” which
performs at the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico
under the direction of Amalia Hernandez, will
be a special treat. It&#39;s a large scale music and
dancing production, with pageantry and
colorful costumes.
With a distinctive musical tradition,
“Theodore Bikel and the Israel Pops Orchestra”
runs the gamut from Hassidic dances to
excerpts from “Exodus” and “Fiddler on the
Roof.” Arrangements by Michael Isaacson
have prompted observers to deﬁne the it as “the
music of the Jewish soul in the tradition of the
Boston Pops.”
The New York City Opera National
Company performs “The Marriage of Figaro” as
the lntemational Season ﬁnale. It will be
performed in Italian (with English supertitles),
and accompanied by a full orchestra.
Artist Series special events include “The
Intimate PDQ. Bach with Professor Peter
Schickele,” ‘The Magic of David Copperﬁeld,”
and “The Comedy of Bob Newhart,” a beneﬁt
for the Mental Health Foundation.
This year, the Artist Series will present two
“Star Concerts,” similar to last year&#39;s Reba
McIntire concert. In January, the new concert
division will host “The Glen Campbell
Goodtime Hour Revisited,” with Glen
Campbell, Jim Stafford, John Hartford and
Nicolette Larsen. Later in the spring, “A
Gathering of Friends,” starring jazz pianist
George Shearing, blues singer Joe Williams and
jazz guitarist Joe Pass, will perform for j azz
enthusiasts in the Florida Theatre. ,
