                        <li><strong>The Diocese of Savannah</strong> (Georgia) has completed its first phase of digitizing the archive of its official newspaper now known as The Southern Cross.  The diocese selected SmallTownPapers, Inc. of Seattle to preserve the newspaper's earliest editions dating back to 1920.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Diocese of Little Rock</strong> (Arkansas)"We started working with SmallTownPapers in 2010 to help us begin the digital archiving project for our
                        centennial in March 2011," said Arkansas Catholic editor MaleaHargett. "We were impressed with the
                        care they take in handling our 100-year-old bound volumes, the quality of their scanning and their free
                        web hosting."</li>
                        <li><strong>Three other Catholic newspapers have also begun the process:</strong>  Catholic Northwest Progress (Seattle, WA), The Message (Evansville, IN) and The Observer (Rockford, IL). </li>
