                                        We made a conscious decision that it was time to begin digitization, due to the accessibility and condition of our bound archives. The best course of action is the scanning program offered by SmallTownPapers. It works. It is low cost, and the digitization is accomplished over time, so we spread out, what little expense there is, over a long period."
