Friday, December 10, 1965 ,--'DESERT PHILOSOPHER'_____, Maturango Museum By &quot;POP&quot; LOFINCK Our Maturango Museum has evolved into a real institution- a great success. And it didn't iust happen. This is how it started.

MANY PITCH IN TO MAKE IT WORK Many people have contributed to the success of the Matu- ranl!o Museum-a list too long for this column. At the head of the list of those who deserve special mention. I would put Rea Blenman, Founding Director; Sylvia Winslow, Founding Curator; and Kenneth H. Rohinson. present director. It seems that wha'ever happens to or about the Museum Ken Robinson is carrying the ball-because he knows how t~ start-when to start-and how to get the idea carried through to a finish. On December 10 is a lecture on the storv of Boron. and Saturday December 11, the next day, a trek through the Borax mIlle. The Museum is open to the public throughout the entire year on Saturdays and Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and by special appointment during the week. . . , I ' Friday, December 10, 1965 NOT5 AII  5.....s Bu\n</content>\n<metadata>\n{'nodeid': '000d6be4', 'fragment': '13'}\n</metadata>\n</llm_doc>\n<llm_doc>\n<score>0.834165</score>\n<content>\nuseum building are urged to attend. AI Christman, chairman of the Museum Building Com- mittee, will present the results of a study to determine the need for a new building, - where it might be located, what kind of building and exhibits might be appropriate and how this all might be funded. This meeting is considered to be a crucial one by the building committee for the gathering of ideas and information needed to form an organization of volunteers necessary for conducting a fund drive that will begin in 1976. Ken Robinson, museum director, will present a short history of the museum since its founding in November 1961. The objective of the triple-feature program is to provide appreciation of the importance of a new museum to the local area, and to gain the kind of public support needed to achieve this goal. ...--- NEW MUSEUM BUILDING BEING PLANNED - Carol Panlaqui, Ken Robinson and AI ChrisJman are shown looking over plans for a new Maturango Museum building, which is scheduled to be built sometime in 1976 or\n</content>\n<metadata>\n{'nodeid': '000d7374', 'fragment': '9'}\n</metadata>\n</llm_doc>\n<llm_doc>\n<score>0.838471</score>\n<content>\n their support of the drive to raise money needed for the construction of a permanent building for the museum. As an Incentive to boost membership In the Maturango Museum. special events having wide appeal to the public are being planned during 1976, with those who are museum members being admitted either free or at a reduced price. The first such activity will be a western fete that is scheduled on Saturday. April 3. adjacent to the museum. where a replica of an old-time mining town will be set up. Special entertainment also is planned. At this time. a sketch of the proposed new permanent museum building will be on display. and local residents will have the opportunity to vote for their choice of a site for the museum - either on regional park land In lUdgecrest or In the vicinity of the Cerro Coso Community College campus.
